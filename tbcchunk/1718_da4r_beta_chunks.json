Because Design Automation is a cloud service, you can use it to create cloud-native applications that work with Revit data. Examples of ways you can use this API include: creating models automatically by entering parameters, validating specified designâ€¯criteria and generating reports, and automatically modifying the model. It is also possible to extract model data not accessible with the Forge Model Derivative API.\n\nFor a high-level introduction, watch the [AU class recording](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Data-Forge-How-Can-Design-Automation-Revit-API-Help-Me-2018).\n\nOur previous discussion of [Design Automation for Revit at AU and in public](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/forge-design-automation-for-revit-at-au-and-in-public.html) highlights\nboth that class, FDC226894, by the Autodesk Revit API development team, and another, AS226079, on managing Revit digital content using DA4R, by external alpha phase developers.\n\nThe official [Forge Design Automation documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview) has\nbeen updated to include the new Revit functionality.\n\nIt includes a [tutorial providing a good starting point to understand how DA4R works](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit).\n\nWe also encourage you to join the [DA4R beta forum](https://beta.autodesk.com/key/Forge_Design_Automation_API_Revit) to\nsee announcements and connect with the development team as well as other partners & customers.\n\nMore tools and samples to help you get started with DA4R are in the works. Stay tuned...\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/da4r.png\" alt=\"Design Automation for Revit\" width=\"527\">\n</center>"
