[The Walrus and The Carpenter](http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html) by Lewis Carroll].\n\nWe also took several walks in the [Odenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odenwald) with his dog Leo:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"/p/2017/2017-10-17_au_darmstadt/odenwald_img_4340.jpg\" alt=\"Walk in the woods\" width=\"320\"/>\n<img src=\"/p/2017/2017-10-17_au_darmstadt/odenwald_img_4344.jpg\" alt=\"Walk in the woods\" width=\"320\"/>\n<img src=\"/p/2017/2017-10-17_au_darmstadt/odenwald_img_4347.jpg\" alt=\"Walk in the woods\" width=\"320\"/>\n</center>\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>Some of My Favourite Recent Books\n\nHere are some of the books I recently read and enjoyed more than others:\n\n- Noam Shpancer: *The Good Psychologist* [en] &ndash; a loving, intelligent, illuminating story of a psychologist in practice and teaching, on practical therapy and theory, interwoven with his own personal love story, loneliness and yearning.\n- Juli Zeh: *Unter Leuten* [de] &ndash; utterly brilliant, loving, deeply psychological and fascinating story about different realities and conflict that the people of a small village create by misunderstanding and for mutual manipulation.\n- Bernhard Jaumann: *Die Vipern von Montesecco* [de] &ndash; a brilliant whodunnit in a small Italian village with everybody under suspicion and the village wholeheartedly determined to solve this to preserve its sense of unity, and solve it with no outside interference.\n- Antonio Manzini: *Non e stagione* [it] &ndash; un giallo, exciting detective story featuring Rocco Schiavione, a totally hip super macho cop from Rome transferred to Aosta and unhappy with snow in May, trying to save an abandoned kidnapped girl from dying.\n- Antonio Manzini: *Pista nera* [it] &ndash; I love Rocco Schiavione and Antonio Manzini; radical militant violent personal integrity, regardless of law and order, serving a higher and personal truth.\n- Antonio Manzini: *La costola di Adamo* [it] &ndash; more radical personal integrity; the topic is political and sociological, femmicide; read the last sentence of the acknowledgements before starting the book; cf. this [quote and my translation](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/change-type-iterate-elements-create-family.html#5).\n- Antonio Manzini: *Era di maggio* [it] &ndash; number four in this series.\n\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>Where to Continue After Finishing School\n\nAnother topic that came up with several friends and their kids is what to do after finishing school.\n\nHere are my three current favourite education options:\n\n- For people who are unsure what they want: [Knowmads Creative International Business School](http://www.knowmads.nl)\n- For young people who know that they want to learn programming in depth: [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)), a private, non-profit and tuition-free computer programming school with campuses in Paris and [Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org)\n- For anyone wishing to quickly and efficiently launch a web programming oriented career from scratch: [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)\n\nMy son attended Knowmads a couple of years ago, and now another friend's daughter is there as well, and extremely enthusiastic about it.\n\n\n####<a name=\"6\"></a>New AlphaGo Zero is Completely Self-Taught\n\nThe AI research community has been very excited indeed lately by the super-human level of performance achieved by [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), by learning from a combination of human knowledge and self-generated experience:\n \n- [AlphaGo beats grand master](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/bim-programming-madrid-and-spanish-connectivity.html#7) \n- [AlphaGo beats world champion](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/ai-news-and-sub-transaction-regen.html#2) \n\nNew research has taken it yet another step further, and \nnow [DeepMind's Go-playing AI doesn't need human help to beat us anymore](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught)\n&ndash; the latest AlphaGo AI learned superhuman skills by playing itself over and over.\n\nHere is a two-and-a-half-minute video about AlphaGo [discovering new knowledge](https://youtu.be/mJ4tEDMksWA):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJ4tEDMksWA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n####<a name=\"7\"></a>TotalPressureLoss Units\n\nBack to the Revit API, and a question in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) \non [`TotalPressureLoss` units](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/totalpressureloss-units/m-p/7452507):\n\nI'm using `MEPSection.TotalPressureLoss` to get the pressure drop of the section.\n\nThe Revit UI tells me, in this example, the pressure drop is 5853Pa.\n\nWhen I get the value using the API, or Revit Lookup, I get the number 1784.0906645432:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/TotalPressureLoss_units.jpg\" alt=\"TotalPressureLoss units\" width=\"712\"/>\n</center>\n\nWhat units is this value in?\n\nThe API documentation on\nthe [TotalPressureLoss property](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/f75e82be-d681-544c-641f-c943765ef2be.htm) says,\n\"default unit is Kgf per square feet\", which has got to be the weirdest unit of pressure ever, but whatever.\n\nWhen I convert 5853Pa to Kgf/Ft^2 I get 55.45, so that can't be the correct unit:\n\n- [WolfranAlpha convert 5853 pascals to kgf/ft^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+5853+pascals+to+kgf%2Fft%5E2)\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nI know it's standard for Revit to convert to some pretty weird units, that's why I'm trying to figure out what this one is. \n\n<center> \n<p style=\"font-size:larger\"><code>5853Pa</code></p>\n</center>\n\nIt's not:\n\n- feet of head (1.958)\n- or inwg (23.497)\n- or psi (.8498)\n- or in Hg (1.728)\n- or cmHg (4.39)\n- or atm (.05766)\n- or bars (58.53)\n \nWhich is all the units that Revit supports as far as I can tell.\n \nIt's also not:\n\n- lbf/yard^2 (1100)\n- or N/yard^2 (4894)\n- or N/foot^2 (543.8)\n- or N/barn (5.853 x 10^-25)\n- or ozf/in^2 (13.58)\n \nI guess it's RPU or Revit Pressure Units or a bug in the code?\n\n**Answer:** The development team responds:\n \nSorry for the hassle.\n\nIt should be:\n\n<center>\n(kg ft / s^2 ) / ft ^2 or kg / (ft s^2)\n</center>\n\nThe best bet for anyone getting values from Revit parameters which are in a more complicated unit than length is to use the `UnitUtils` method `ConvertFromInternalUnits` to the display unit type you want."
