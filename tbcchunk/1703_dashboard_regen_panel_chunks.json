Can we get more detail and more examples?\n- Access to the actual line weight definitions (i.e., line weight 5 means 8 pixels, for example) \n- Expose the group transform\n- Rehost a family instance\n    - Definitely doesn't work on face based but would like it to work in all cases\n    - Also needs to work on links\n- Ability to draw on the canvas in front of elements\n    - `DirectContext3D` draws behind elements\n- Make `DirectContext3D` show up in printing\n- `ReferenceIntersector`\n    - Make the calculation cached somehow so it's not slow every time you use it on a closed view?\n    - Can it work in non-3d views? \n- CAD links\n    - Get text box notes out of a CAD link from the API\n    - Also allow explode via the API\n    - Workaround: use dxf file?\n- Getting multiple lines when two elements intersect in multiple places\n    - [The note taker is not sure what she meant here. Interference check?] \n- Key schedules\n    - Either need to be able to make key schedules using shared parameters, or need to be able to make internal parameters with the API. [Note taker: it might mean normal where it says internal?]\n- Rearrange the parameter list from the API\n- [non-API?] When making a section or section box, can we have the new view keep the same design options as the original view?"

It would be expected if you have a modal dialog. \n- If you modify the two coordinates of a sloped pipe in the API, then the UI doesn't update properly.

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2.4\"></a> Questions\n\n- How do you know when Revit is in a state where it will respond to an event? \n    - You can’t definitively know. It’s why it has to be an asynchronous mechanism.  \n- Can you have arguments with ExternalEvents?\n    - Yes, although [didn’t manage to write the answer down]\n- Can I make an OptionsBar via the API?\n    - No because Revit is moving away from options bars. We want everything on the ribbon. \n- Revit core console, similar to the AutoCAD core console? \n    - No, this is not something we’re planning to support at this time.\n- Why are slow FilteredElementCollectors of variable speed depending on whether the view's been opened or not? \n    - [trying to condense a rambling answer] The fast filters don’t need all of an element’s information to work. The slow filters need everything, and that 'everything' is usually first read in when you open a view containing the element. It’s a one-time operation. So, if the view is already open, the slow filters are faster because that work’s already been done."

My IT Director is currently working on the subject but not knowledgeable in the API Revit, and me too. I would like to save some time by asking in this forum who could guide us towards a solution.\n\n**Answer:** Here are some suggestions on various topics:\n\nFirst of all, you need to work through the material to help [getting started with the Revit API](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).\n\nBefore getting started with the Revit API, you should acquire as much knowledge as possible about Revit from the end user point of view.\n\nI would assume that you already have that &nbsp; :-)\n\nHere is one very old analysis\nof [integrating Revit with an external database](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/database-integration.html).\n\nMany things have improved significantly since then, and your target is probably quite different (and much simpler than) the one discussed there.\n\nStill, that article might provide a few useful hints.\n\nBy the way, talking about dashboards and things:\n\nI would strongly encourage you to look at a partially cloud-based solution, to provide convenient access to a much larger audience in a much more scalable manner, with access to a huge number of public domain JavaScript-based libraries that can vastly simplify your work and integration efforts.\n\nHere are some links to information about my own\nsamples [integrating desktop and cloud, provided in the FireRatingCloud overview](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud).\n\nThey are also already pretty dated.\n\nSince then, Autodesk has made significant progress with [Forge](https://autodesk-forge.github.io),\nand [Forge design Automation for Revit is just around the corner](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/forge-design-automation-for-revit-at-au-and-in-public.html).\n\nMaybe that will provide the most efficient path forward for your project as well?\n\nGood luck getting started and looking forward very much to continuing this discussion once you have gotten your feet wet."

I have most of the bits of code required for the task, but I really have no clue on when to use `doc.Regenerate` or not (the less the better for best performance, and I understand that I may have to organize my add-in in order to minimize the number of calls).\n\nI have browsed the Internet, including Jeremy's blog notes on the topic, but it still seems to me that it remains some kind of trial and error operation.\n\nAre there any guidelines, recommendations or documentation on the type of Revit database update operations that require the use of `doc.Regenerate` inside a transaction?\n\n**Answer:** Indeed, it may seem a bit like trial and error.\n\nIn general, however, it should probably be pretty clear.\n\nWhenever a transaction is committed, Revit regenerates the document for you anyway, so you do not have to call it in that case.\n\nThat will take care of many situations.\n\nThe only cases that require explicit regen are when you make <u>several</u> different modifications within one single transaction, and/or query the model <u>after</u> some of them have been make.\n\nIn that case, you may be retrieving <u>stale data</u>, outdated information that requires a regen to take the most recent modifications into account.\n\nIn general, I would probably not make any calls to `Regenerate` until I notice that something is going wrong.\n\nJust keep in mind what can go wrong when stale data is accessed and used, always check your results, and be ready to add a regen call in case of need.\n\nIf you have read and understood all the examples listed in\nthe [topic group on the need to regenerate](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.33),\nyou should be well prepared to address your programming task, at least as far as this aspect is concerned.\n\nGood luck!\n\n**Response:** Thanks for the confirmation, Jeremy. It is more or less what I expected. I have some experience on AutoCAD programming, where there was also a need to regenerate from time to time (but I was more or less aware about the rules of the game).\n\nI will re-read your blog inputs on the topic before getting deeply into the add-in and I will test sequences of operations to check whether they require a `Regenerate` operation or not."
