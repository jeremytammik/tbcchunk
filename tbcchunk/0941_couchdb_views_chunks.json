references.</p>\n<p>As\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/room-editor-project-overview-and-couchdb-configuration.html#6\">\nsaid</a>,\n\nI can use <a href=\"http://kan.so\">Kanso</a> to maintain and install the database, push the views and upload my documents in JSON format to the local CouchDB database 'roomedit' using commands such as these:</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">\n$ kanso install\n\n$ kanso push http://localhost:5984/roomedit\n\n$ kanso upload mydata.json http://localhost:5984/roomedit\n</pre>\n<p>I ended up implementing my totally own version of a CouchDB application, unlike anything I saw in any of the samples.</p>\n<p>Basically, I only use a couple of CouchDB views and a rather heavy-weight index.html file that renders them for various contexts, guiding the user through the model and room selection process and finally displaying the SVG editor page.</p>\n<p>The selection logic is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home page: list all models and prompt to select one of them.</li>\n<li>Model selected: list all levels in model and prompt to select one of them.</li>\n<li>Level selected: list all rooms on the level and prompt to select one of them.</li>\n<li>Room selected: display the room boundary and the furniture and equipment instances graphically and enable editing their location and rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first three steps were not so hard once I understood about CouchDB views and discovered how to render them in index.htm.</p>\n<p>Integrating the SVG editor posed some really tough problems, but ended up being really simple as well.</p>\n<p>For a while I was unsure whether I would be able to use the <a href=\"http://raphaeljs.com\">Raphaël</a> JavaScript SVG library as is, or whether it needed to be packaged as a Kanso package.\nAs it turned out, that was not necessary.\nUntil I discovered that the hard way, though, I tried to avoid the use of any non-Kanso libraries at all, and struggled with SVG editing issues instead.</p>\n<p>So let's start by looking at the simplest step first, how to list all models and prompt the user to select one of them.</p>\n<a name=\"5\"></a>\n<h4>Home Page: List all Models and Select One</h4>\n<p>The initial home page of my application is very simple.\nIt looks like this, listing the available models and prompting the user to select one of them:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Roomedit home page populated by JavaScript from CouchDB view\" src=\"img/roomedit_home_screen.png\"/>\n</center>\n<p>I represent each Revit model as a separate CouchDB document.\nAll the data it carries is inherited from the DbObj base class, which specifies its type \"model\", description and name.\nI populate the two latter with information from the Revit ProjectInfo singleton object, and I use the Revit UniqueId as the CouchDB document identifier as well.</p>\n<p>The resulting CouchDB JSON representation of my sample model looks like this (copy to an editor or view the HTML source to see the truncated lines in full):</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n{\n  \"_id\": \"bf0552b6-b7f7-4331-96d5-b19843262895-00015084\",\n  \"_rev\": \"14-4e1c947c3d3e354117a1f016f2e23f63\",\n  \"type\": \"model\",\n  \"description\": \"ProjectInfo Project Information &lt;86148 Project Information&gt;\",\n  \"name\": \"room_with_hole.rvt\"\n}\n</pre>\n<p>CouchDB implements and extremely scalable architecture and can host millions of documents.</p>\n<p>Views are used to efficiently extract the ones required.\nA view can implement a map and a reduce function.\nThe map function identifies the documents of interest and maps them to a key-value pair.\nThe optional reduce function can be applied to reduce the results by accumulation or other means.\nI have no use for reduce in my application.</p>\n<p>To list all available models, I use an utterly trivial view function that does not even create real key-value pairs.\nAll I need is to extract all model documents and list the model document information itself, so I just emit all model documents as keys directly:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nexports.models = {\n  map: function (doc) {\n    if( 'model' == doc.type ) {\n      emit(doc, null);\n    }\n  }\n};\n</pre>\n<p>To render the results of the view into my HTML target file, I define the following scaffolding:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  &lt;h1&gt;Room Editor&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n  &lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;ul id=\"navigatorlist\"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n</pre>\n<p>In the JavaScript section, I require the Kanso db and jquery packages:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  var db = require('db').current();\n  var $ = require('jquery');\n</pre>\n<p>The db package provides access to the current CouchDB database, and jquery is a Kanso wrapper for the standard jquery library.</p>\n<p>Oh, and what is Kanso itself?\nKanso is a framework enabling me to maintain my CouchDB views and other bits and pieces in standard file system files on the hard disk and upload them easily to the CouchDB database.</p>\n<p>With that in place, the following JavaScript code queries the 'models' view and populates the HTML placeholder tags:</p>\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n// display a menu of all available models\n\ndb.getView('room_loops', 'models',\n  function (err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      return alert(err);\n    }\n    var n = data.rows.length;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n      var doc = data.rows[i].key;\n      var s = url + '?modelid=' + doc._id;\n      $('&lt;li/&gt;').append($('&lt;a&gt;')\n        .attr('href',s)\n        .text(doc.name))\n      .appendTo('#navigatorlist');\n    }\n    var p = $('&lt;p/&gt;').appendTo('#content');\n    p.append( $('&lt;a/&gt;').text('Home').attr('href',url) );\n    p.append( document.createTextNode( three_spaces ) );\n    p.append( $('&lt;a/&gt;').text('Back').attr('href',url) );\n\n    $('&lt;p/&gt;')\n      .text( 'Please select a model in the list below.' )\n      .appendTo('#content');\n\n    var prompt = n.toString() + ' model'\n      + pluralSuffix( n ) + dotOrColon( n );\n\n    $('&lt;p/&gt;').text( prompt ).appendTo('#content');\n  }\n);\n</pre>\n<p>As you can see, the db.getView method is provided with three arguments: the database name, the view name, and a call-back function.</p>\n<p>Understanding how the call-back function works was another big stumbling block for me.</p>\n<p>In this simple case, all is clear, of course.</p>\n<p>We submit the query to get the view and return immediately.</p>\n<p>CouchDB processes the request and invokes the call-back function when completed.</p>\n<p>The call-back function processes the resulting data rows, extracting the model document data from the key provided with each row and populating the HTML scaffolding accordingly.</p>\n<p>Again, here is the final result with two models listed, just as you can see in the video above:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Roomedit home page populated by JavaScript from CouchDB view\" src=\"img/roomedit_home_screen.png\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Well, I am spending much too much time documenting this for you, and really need to get on with the implementation and my real day work, so I will call it wraps for today now.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Cloud and Mobile</h1>\n<h3>2D Mobile Revit Model Editing Update</h3>\n<p>By\n\n<a

    "chunk_text": "<h4>Home Page: List all Models and Select One</h4><p>The initial home page of my application is very simple.\nIt looks like this, listing the available models and prompting the user to select one of them:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Roomedit home page populated by JavaScript from CouchDB view\" src=\"img/roomedit_home_screen.png\"/>\n</center><p>I represent each Revit model as a separate CouchDB document.\nAll the data it carries is inherited from the DbObj base class, which specifies its type \"model\", description and name.\nI populate the two latter with information from the Revit ProjectInfo singleton object, and I use the Revit UniqueId as the CouchDB document identifier as well.</p><p>The resulting CouchDB JSON representation of my sample model looks like this (copy to an editor or view the HTML source to see the truncated lines in full):</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n{\n  \"_id\": \"bf0552b6-b7f7-4331-96d5-b19843262895-00015084\",\n  \"_rev\": \"14-4e1c947c3d3e354117a1f016f2e23f63\",\n  \"type\": \"model\",\n  \"description\": \"ProjectInfo Project Information &lt;86148 Project Information&gt;\",\n  \"name\": \"room_with_hole.rvt\"\n}\n</pre><p>CouchDB implements and extremely scalable architecture and can host millions of documents.</p><p>Views are used to efficiently extract the ones required.\nA view can implement a map and a reduce function.\nThe map function identifies the documents of interest and maps them to a key-value pair.\nThe optional reduce function can be applied to reduce the results by accumulation or other means.\nI have no use for reduce in my application.</p><p>To list all available models, I use an utterly trivial view function that does not even create real key-value pairs.\nAll I need is to extract all model documents and list the model document information itself, so I just emit all model documents as keys directly:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nexports.models = {\n  map: function (doc) {\n    if( 'model' == doc.type ) {\n      emit(doc, null);\n    }\n  }\n};\n</pre><p>To render the results of the view into my HTML target file, I define the following scaffolding:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  &lt;h1&gt;Room Editor&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n  &lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;ul id=\"navigatorlist\"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n</pre><p>In the JavaScript section, I require the Kanso db and jquery packages:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  var db = require('db').current();\n  var $ = require('jquery');\n</pre><p>The db package provides access to the current CouchDB database, and jquery is a Kanso wrapper for the standard jquery library.</p><p>Oh, and what is Kanso itself?\nKanso is a framework enabling me to maintain my CouchDB views and other bits and pieces in standard file system files on the hard disk and upload them easily to the CouchDB database.</p><p>With that in place, the following JavaScript code queries the 'models' view and populates the HTML placeholder tags:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n// display a menu of all available models\n\ndb.getView('room_loops', 'models',\n  function (err, data) {\n    if (err) {\n      return alert(err);\n    }\n    var n = data.rows.length;\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {\n      var doc = data.rows[i].key;\n      var s = url + '?modelid=' + doc._id;\n      $('&lt;li/&gt;').append($('&lt;a&gt;')\n        .attr('href',s)\n        .text(doc.name))\n      .appendTo('#navigatorlist');\n    }\n    var p = $('&lt;p/&gt;').appendTo('#content');\n    p.append( $('&lt;a/&gt;').text('Home').attr('href',url) );\n    p.append( document.createTextNode( three_spaces ) );\n    p.append( $('&lt;a/&gt;').text('Back').attr('href',url) );\n\n    $('&lt;p/&gt;')\n      .text( 'Please select a model in the list below.' )\n      .appendTo('#content');\n\n    var prompt = n.toString() + ' model'\n      + pluralSuffix( n ) + dotOrColon( n );\n\n    $('&lt;p/&gt;').text( prompt ).appendTo('#content');\n  }\n);\n</pre><p>As you can see, the db.getView method is provided with three arguments: the database name, the view name, and a call-back function.</p><p>Understanding how the call-back function works was another big stumbling block for me.</p><p>In this simple case, all is clear, of course.</p><p>We submit the query to get the view and return immediately.</p><p>CouchDB processes the request and invokes the call-back function when completed.</p><p>The call-back function processes the resulting data rows, extracting the model document data from the key provided with each row and populating the HTML scaffolding accordingly.</p><p>Again, here is the final result with two models listed, just as you can see in the video above:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Roomedit home page populated by JavaScript from CouchDB view\" src=\"img/roomedit_home_screen.png\"/>\n</center><p>Well, I am spending much too much time documenting this for you, and really need to get on with the implementation and my real day work, so I will call it wraps for today now.</p><hr/>"

This is currently a command triggered by the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a little two-minute film demonstrating the current functionality to give you the idea:</p>\n<center>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-FjXWokH1Ss\" width=\"420\"></iframe>\n</center>\n</p>"
