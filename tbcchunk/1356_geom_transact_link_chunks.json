This is an error I get when using the `NewSpace` method:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/no_modify_linked_file.png\" alt=\"No modifying linked files\" width=\"445\"/>\n</center>\n\nI call the method inside a transaction in the main document and it does nothing to the error.\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span> uiapp = commandData.Application;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">UIDocument</span> uidoc = uiapp.ActiveUIDocument;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Application</span> app = uiapp.Application;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Document</span> doc = uidoc.Document;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span> (<span class=\"teal\">Document</span> d <span class=\"blue\">in</span> app.Documents)\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">using</span> (<span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span> t = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>(doc))\n&nbsp; &nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t.Start(<span class=\"maroon\">&quot;New Space&quot;</span>);\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Space</span> sp = d.Create.NewSpace( ... );\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; t.Commit();\n&nbsp; &nbsp; }&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n&nbsp; }\n</pre>\n\nCould this error be due to the fact that I am calling `NewSpace` in the Linked element but the transaction is in the primary one?\n\nRevit does not seem to allow me to use transactions in anything but the primary document.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions of how I might be able to edit the linked element successfully I would be very appreciative.\n\n**Answer:**\nYes, absolutely, a transaction is totally tied to a document.\n\nIf you have two separate documents to modify, you need two separate transactions for them.\n\nIf your subtransaction is in a different document B, it cannot be nested into a transaction tied to document A.\n\nHowever, what is even more applicable in this particular case is the fact that linked documents are not modifiable &ndash; they cannot have any transactions at all.\n\nIn order to modify a linked document, one would have to close the link, open the document as a separate main document, make the changes there, save it, and link it back again in the original host."
