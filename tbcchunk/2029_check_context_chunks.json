Revit is currently not within an API context.\n\n> Meaning: you can use that to know if your code is in context or not.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ricaun_in_context.png\" alt=\"In Revit API context check\" title=\"In Revit API context check\" width=\"740\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 303 Pixel Width: 740 -->\n</center>\n\n> - [Code sample and video](https://ricaun.com/revit-api-context/)\n- 14-minute video on [Tasks and InContext in Revit API](https://youtu.be/gyo6xGN5DDU)\n\n> I'm using this technique using my open source library to manage the creation of an external event if it is not in context and enable it to run Revit API asynchronously in [ricaun.Revit.UI.Tasks](https://github.com/ricaun-io/ricaun.Revit.UI.Tasks).\n\nMany thanks to ricaun for sharing this long-sought-after solution!"
