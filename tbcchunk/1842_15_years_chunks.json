Now it uses a ForgeUnitID instead of a DisplayUnitType enum member.\n  My question is: Why the code that's been originally written in the 2019 version works seemlessly in Revit 2021 ?\n  A: Good question.\n  The answer is simple: the methods provided by the Revit API assemblies to serve the Revit API calls made by your add-in remain unchanged.\n  New methods have been added, for instance, the new unit API ones that you mention. However, you are not using them, so that makes no difference for your add-in.\n  Other methods may have been changed or even removed.

A big milestone! \n<p style=\"font-size: 40%\"> </p>\nJeremy joined Autodesk as a member of Autodesk Consultant and shortly after he moved to our team. At that time, Revit API was still toddler. We were pushing API both directions: internally to push Revit toward API first, and externally evangelize with very little API. Jeremy was instrumental for that task, especially for external customer facing side. At that time, many of us were not sure how much we can form for community based support. Jeremy made a big success with his Building Coder blog. He got a nickname “King of Revit API”.  Some developer said Jeremy is posting like “machinegun.” Now Revit API community is the most active one among Autodesk product APIs.\n<p style=\"font-size: 40%\"> </p>\nMany thanks for your contribution, Jeremy~  Great to have you in our team!\n<p style=\"font-size: 40%\"> </p></li>\n<li>Chandra Shekar G: Congratulations Jeremy on completion of big milestone!!! \n<p style=\"font-size: 40%\"> </p></li>\n<li>Virupaksha Aithal K M: Thank you, Jeremy, &ndash; “King of Revit” &#x263A; ...

One prerequisite for this is a transformation towards holistic, process-oriented and digital value chains based on an open-minded, collaborative mentality of all participants. The Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodology and Lean Construction (LC) are two approaches that can facilitate this. In this context, the Work Cycle based approach is examined regarding possibilities for its digital implementation &ndash; in particular, by applying and integrating the BIM methodology. For this purpose, scientific work and software solutions used in practice are analysed. Based on this, a concept of a software system is presented that comprises a holistic approach for the digital transformation of Work Cycle Based Time Planning and Control. The software concept consists of a visual programming based application for planning as well as a modular, web-based application based on the central control tool, Work Cycle Control Panels. Underlying these two software applications, the use of a central database and a digital LC model also introduced in this paper ensures a continuous data flow. Finally, demonstration applications are implemented to demonstrate the realisation of a software implementation with usage examples."
