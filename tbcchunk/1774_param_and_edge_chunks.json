    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Shared Parameter is Either Type or Instance\n\nFrom the StackOverflow question\non [how to bind a shared parameter to both type and instance elements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57653886/how-to-bind-a-shared-parameter-to-elements-of-both-type-and-instance):\n\n**Question:** I create a shared parameter programmatically. This works well. I can also bind that parameter to different element types (categories) like Windows or Doors. However, once that is done for a type, I struggle to create a new binding to instances instead.\n\nIs there any way to use ONE single shared parameter and bind that to both types and instances?\n\n**Answer:** I believe not. A shared parameter is bound to either types or instances, not both.\n\n**Response:** Thank you for answering so quickly.\n\nI now tried to do it manually as well, through the UI, and got the message that it has already been added, so, unfortunately, you seem to be right. I am probably not the first to say this, but that is just weird behaviour. It forces me to create two parameters which have the completely identical definition to add them to different categories.\n\n**Answer:** Yes.\n\nYou must take into consideration that the shared parameters functionality was added very early in the Revit lifecycle and was completely oriented toward end user interaction. At the time, the Revit API did not even exist, and was not planned for.\n\nPossibly your use case is weird, from a BIM point of view. I am not an expert on the user interface side of things, so I cannot say.\n\nOn the other hand, [extensible storage](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.23) was explicitly designed for API use.\n\nIf you do not explicitly need the end user or Revit to see and manipulate your data, e.g., for scheduling or other purposes, you should consider using extensible storage instead.\n\nNeither Revit nor the end user will effectively see your extensible storage data.\n\nDepending on your exact needs, this may be what you want or not."

So, I don't have to create them, just set their values. I'm off the hook for now..."
