Its main purpose is to easily change family types.\n\nYou select a Revit view. The application retrieves all the families and types in the view.\nYou select a family and it shows you the different types.\nFinally it displays two columns A and B. In Column A you select the type of family you have in the view and want to be substituted.\nIn Column B you select the new one.\nYou click apply and the change is done.\n\nThe problem is that when I implement this in Revit, some families do not show their family names or types.\n\nWhat do you think I am  missing?\n\n**Answer:**\nFirst of all, most questions like this have already been answered. Make sure you perform some Internet searches, check\n[The Building Coder topic groups](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5), look through\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) etc.\n\nNote that the `Category` property is not always implemented on families, so you may have to use `FamilyCategory` instead, or the category of the family's first symbol.\n\nThe thread\non [extracting family name and type from object](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/extracting-family-name-and-type-from-object/m-p/3093998) addresses a similar topic.\n\nTaking a deeper look at your question, I believe that almost everything you need is already implemented in the external command Lab3_4_ChangeSelectedInstanceType of\nthe [ADN Xtra Labs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra) module [Labs3.cs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/blob/master/XtraCs/Labs3.cs).\n\nHere are links to two more related discussions for you,\non [changing an element type](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/change-element-type.html) and [changing the type of many instances](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/changing-the-type-of-many-instances.html)."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"5\"></a>La Costola di Adamo\n\nTo wrap up, let me mention a non-Revit-API issue:\n\nI was deeply touched as well as horrified and angry after\nreading [La Costola di Adamo](http://sellerio.it/it/catalogo/Costola-Adamo/Manzini/7240) by\nAntonio Manzini, an Italian detective story. Here is a quote from the diary of the female victim of the story:\n\nDomenica sono andata in chiesa. Non volevo sentire la messa. Voleva guardare la chiesa. Ho sbagliato orario. Sono entrata e c'era proprio la messa. Il prete ha letto la Genesi, 2:21.23. Me la sono riletta a casa. Dice: Allora l'eterno Iddio fece cadere un profondo sonno sull'uomo, che s'addormento. E prese una delle costole di lui; e richiuse la carne al posto d'essa. E l'eterno Iddio, con la costola che aveva tolto all'uomo, formo una donna e la condusse all'uomo. E l'uomo disse: \"Questa finalmente e ossa delle mie ossa e carne della mia carne. Ella sarà chiamata donna perché e stata tratta dall'uomo.\"\n\nMi sono messa a pensare. A sentire la storiella, la donna nasce dall'uomo, anzi ne e proprio un pezzo. E l'uomo impazzisce per la donna, la ama. In realtà ama se stesso. Ama un pezzo di se, non un altro da se. Vive e fa i figli e fa l'amore con se stesso. Un amore concentrato sulla propria persona che niente ha che fare con l'amore. Credo che sia quanto di più perverso abbia mai letto. Il maschio e innamorato solo di se. Questo dicono le Sacre Scritture. L'inferiorità femminile non c'entra. E solo un mezzo per coprire tutto il resto.\n\nL'appartenenza. Una persona appartiene ad un'altra. Per decreto divino. Ovvia la mia vita ha valore perché appartengo all'uomo. Bestie, case, terreni e donne. Appartengono.\n\n*Sunday I went to church. I did not want to hear mass. I wanted to look at the church.\nI mistook the time. I entered and mass had already started. The priest read Genesis 2:21.23.\nI re-read it at home. It says:\nAnd the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;\nAnd the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.\nAnd Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.*\n\n*I started to think. According to the story, the woman comes from the man, and indeed, is a piece of him.\nAnd the man loves the woman. Actually he loves himself. He loves a piece of himself, not another.\nThey live together and have children and he makes love with himself.\nA love focused on one's self has nothing to do with love.\nI think that is the most perverse thing I have ever read.\nThe male in love only with himself. This is what the Holy Scriptures say.\nThe female inferiority is not even part of it. It is only a means to cover all the rest.*\n\n*Belonging. One person belongs to another. By divine decree. Obviously my life has value because I belong to the man. Animals, houses, land and women. Belonging.*\n\nIn his acknowledgements at the end of the book, Manzini clarifies:\n\n> Al 21 novembre dell'anno 2013, anno in cui ho scritto il libro, i casi di femmicidio in Italia sono stati 122. Finche il numero non si azzererà, non potremmo definirci un paese civile.\n\n> *On November 21. 2013, the year in which I wrote this book, the cases of femicide in Italy were 122.\nUntil this number is reduced, we cannot consider ourselves a civilised country.*\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/la_costola_di_adamo.jpg\" alt=\"La Costola di Adamo\" width=\"224\"/>\n</center>\n\nSo, I'll end the week on this rather sombre note and wish everybody a peaceful and relaxing weekend.\n\n<!----\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n**Question:**\n\n**Answer:**\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"\"/>\n</center>\n\n- create a roof\n  http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/help-creating-roof/m-p/5828806\n  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32718999/creating-a-roof-function/32732012#32732012"

I know how to create a stairs for example : I start a StairsEditScope and use CreateSketchedLanding with all the right parameters to create my stairs and just commit the StairsEditScope, but for a roof i cant find a clue on how to create it from scratch, any leads?\n\n**Answer:**\nRevit provides different kinds of roofs. It is best to understand the various types from an end user point of view before starting to drive them programmatically. The simplest one is defined by a horizontal outline. You can create a roof from such an outline using the Document.NewFootPrintRoof method. Such a roof can be flat, or you can specify a slope for each edge of the outline profile. The Building Coder Xtra labs provide a working sample in the external command Lab2_0_CreateLittleHouse in Labs2.cs:\n\nhttps://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/blob/master/XtraCs/Labs2.cs\n\nHere are some other roof-related posts on The Building Coder:\n\nRoomsRoofs SDK Sample\nRoof Eave Cut\nCreating an Extrusion Roof\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nCheers, Jeremy.\n\n<!- 0015 0198 1215 ->\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/roomsroofs-sdk.html\">RoomsRoofs SDK Sample</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/roof-eave-cut-in-revit-and-aca.html\">Roof Eave Cut in AutoCAD Architecture and Revit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/events-again-and-creating-an-extrusion-roof.html\">Events, Again, and Creating an Extrusion Roof</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n-->"
