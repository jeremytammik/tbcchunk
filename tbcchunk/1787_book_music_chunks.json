Programming in Revit software seems like a scary thing, but it doesn’t have to be. We will present on how to start using the Revit API using free tools. This class will guide attendees who use Revit but have never tried to access the API to accomplish simple tasks. Using element filters, transactions, and user interface will be the main focus. This will give each attendee a basic understanding and road map to creating their own scripts for Revit. We will use the following software: Revit, RevitPythonShell, RevitLookup, and pyRevit. Attendees will need basic understanding of Revit and entry-level understanding of Python.\n\nMaterial included:\n\n- Overview\n- Video &ndash; 1 hour 1 min\n- Handout &ndash; 12 pages\n- Presentation &ndash; 17 slides\n- Downloads &ndash; 3 files\n\nLink:\n\n<center>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Programming-Beginners-Easily-Access-Revit-API-Using-Free-Tools-2018\">Revit Programming for Beginners: Easily Access the Revit API Using Free Tools</a></p>\n<br/>\n</center>"
