    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>REST vs WebSocket and Roomedit3dv3 Broadcast Architecture\n\n[Philippe Leefsma](http://twitter.com/F3lipek) and I discussed how to communicate end user modifications made using the custom viewer extension back to the Revit add-in to update the BIM.\n\nPhilippe suggested:\n\n> Putting all the code into a viewer extension to make it pretty easy to manage. I could add potentially useful features to my server if needed by your app.\n \n**Question:** In my previous architecture, I used REST to notify the server from the client, and `socket.io` from the server to the rest of the world.\n \n- Client viewer extension &rarr; REST &rarr; server &rarr; `socket.io` &rarr; desktop\n \nTherefore, I did not just add a pure client viewer extension, but also fiddled around in the server a bit as well.\n \nShould I try to put the `socket.io` broadcast directly into the viewer extension, and avoid the extra communication step?\n \n- Client viewer extension &rarr; `socket.io` &rarr; desktop\n \nHere is the architecture implementation that I used successfully for that last time around:\n \n- [Viewer extension](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/www/js/extensions/Roomedit3dTranslationTool.js)\n- [Client notification to server](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/www/js/roomedit3dapiclient.js)\n- [Server broadcast request API endpoint](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/routes/api/roomedit3d.js)\n- [Server broadcast relay](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/server.js#L54-L60)\n \n**Answer:** You have to go from client to server if you want to broadcast a message to other connected clients, but it seems like you don't need to handle any very specific logic on the server; basically the server can expose a generic REST endpoint which will receive a message and dispatch it to all other clients except the one that initiated the request.\n \nThe server already implements a `SocketSvc` socket service which we can use for that.\n\nThere are two options how this can be implemented:\n\n1. Similar to what you did last time: REST endpoint exposed by server, client calls POST with a payload containing message, server broadcast to all other clients.\n2. Client uses socket to send message to server, server broadcasts message to all other clients.\n\nIn both cases I need to add a little piece of code to my server, so the feature is more generic than what you did last time. I will also add a SocketService on the client side, so it's easy to use.\n\nHere is an illuminating read on a [REST vs WebSocket comparison and benchmarks](http://blog.arungupta.me/rest-vs-websocket-comparison-benchmarks).\n\nTake a look at that and decide which is more suitable for your scenario.\n\nLater: I just finished adding a thin wrapper around client side socket.\n \nIt is now wrapped in a 'service' making it avail application-wide through the client-side `ServiceManager` like this:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nimport ServiceManager from 'Services/SvcManager'\n \nvar svc = ServiceManager.getService('SocketSvc')\n \nsvc.broadcast('your-msg-id', {data...})\n</pre>\n\nAll other clients but the initiator will receive the message.\n \nAn example of using this is provided in the [client App.js](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs/blob/master/6%20-%20viewer%2Bserver%2Bdata-mng%2Bderivatives/src/client/App.js#L251).\n\nTime for me to get going on implementing and using this, then."
