Hurra!\nMy blog output will slow down or more probably stop completely during this time. \nI wish all the readers of \"The Building Coder\" the very best. \nThank you for your support and readership over the past months. \nI have very much enjoyed writing for and communicating with you, and I am looking forward to a fun, productive and communicative 2009! :-)</p>"
