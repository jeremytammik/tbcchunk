    "local_header_href": "#2",
    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Can You Avoid Generating Graphics?\n\nSeveral developers encountered performance problems filtering for elements based on the view containing them.\n\nIn order to determine which elements are displayed in a view, the view has to be regenerated.\n\nThe first time this happens, Revit may display a progress bar saying 'Generating graphics'.\n\nThis can be triggered by a filtered element collector as well.\n\nIn the following, I'll summarise a couple of discussions around this topic.\n\nThe most recent was is the StackOverflow question\non [Revit : get all ViewSheet is very slow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58593436/revit-get-all-viewsheet-is-very-slow):\n\n**Question:** For a plugin, I need to get all the viewsheets in the RVT file and display information from them in a XAML dialog.\nThis process is very, very slow the first time I use it:\nwith the debugger, it takes 500 ms for 83 plan views, and it is very slow without the debugger too.\nIf I execute the code again, the execution is instantaneous.\nThis code is causing it:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">protected</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">IEnumerable</span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Element</span>&gt;&nbsp;GetAllEl(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Document</span>&nbsp;doc&nbsp;)\n{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">return</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">FilteredElementCollector</span>(&nbsp;doc&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.OfCategory(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInCategory</span>.OST_Sheets&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.WhereElementIsNotElementType()\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.OfClass(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">typeof</span>(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ViewSheet</span>&nbsp;)&nbsp;);\n}\n</pre>\n\n**Answer:** I do not think there is currently a known generic solution for that problem.\n\nA similar issue was just discussed with the development team:\n\n**Question:** For a given element id, we need to find the list of sheet ids displaying it.\nCurrent solution: we loop through all the sheets and views and use `FilteredElementCollector( doc, sheet.Id )`.\nWith the results from that, we perform one more call to `FilteredElementCollector( doc, view.Id )` and look for the element id.\nIssue: the current solution takes a lot of time and displays a Revit progress bar saying `Generating graphics`.\nIs there any better way to know if a given element id is available in the sheet or not?\nFor example, some API methods like this would be very useful:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  getAllSheets(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ElementId</span>&nbsp;)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;returns&nbsp;array&nbsp;of&nbsp;sheet&nbsp;id</span>\n  hasGuid(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ElementId</span>,&nbsp;sheetId&nbsp;)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;return&nbsp;true/false</span>\n</pre>\n\nDoes the API provide any such methods, to check whether a given `ElementId` is available in the sheet?\n\n**Answer:** So. the goal is to find a view that displays a particular element on a sheet?\nMany model elements could be visible on multiple views, while most annotation elements are typically present only in one view.\nWhat type of elements are you checking for?\nAnd what will you do with that info?\n\n**Response:** The goal is to find a view that displays a particular element on a sheet.\nIt can be any type of element.\n\n**Answer:** Here are some previous related discussions:\n\n- [Determining Views Showing an Element](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/12/determining-views-showing-an-element.html)\n- The inverse, [Retrieving Elements Visible in View](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/retrieving-elements-visible-in-view.html)\n\n**Response:** The problem is that the first call to `FilteredElementCollector( doc, viewId )` shows `generating graphics` in the progress bar.\nOnly the first-time search does so.\nThe second time, search on the same view has no issues with performance.\n\n**Answer:** The first time is slow because in order to iterate on the elements visible in a view, the graphics for that view must be generated.\nI can't think of a workaround to get a precise answer.\nYou might be able to skip sheets which don't have model views in their viewport list to save a bit of time.\nSome sheets may only have drafting views and schedules and annotations.\n\nThe development team provided a very helpful suggestion which helped work around the `generating graphics` call by avoiding that specific filtering operation completely in another case,\nto [loop through sheets generating graphics](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/loop-through-sheets-generating-graphics/m-p/8719256).\n\nThe solution there consisted in analysing exactly what relationship you are trying to retrieve.\nIn that specific case, the Revit API provided direct support for the inverse relationship, so you can retrieve that and invert it to access the required elements.\n\nMaybe you can optimise in a similar manner for your needs?"

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> Read all Thermal and Physical Assets\n\n**Question:** Is there a way to get the list of all Thermal and Physical assets using Revit 2019 API?\n\n**Answer:** Those are used in Materials. I think you'd want to iterate over all materials in the document and look at each for its StructuralAssetId and ThermalAssetId.\nYou can then look at the PropertySetElements that use those ids.\nYou could probably also iterate PropertySetElements directly, which would be fine if you don't need to know what materials are using them.\n\n**Response:** Thanks, just now got them as you suggested from the discussion \non [material assets collector for appearance, structural (physical) and thermal](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/material-assets-collector-appearance-structural-physical-amp/m-p/7269088):\n\nWe are trying to gather all the material assets loaded into a project file but ran into a roadblock.\nWe can successfully do this for the appearance assets, but for the other assets the approach does not work.\n\nThe only way that we can gather the structural and thermal assets is by starting with materials and cycle through the assets that are assigned.\nThis approach will omit assets that are not assigned to materials.\n\nPlease see C# code below for reference.

a recognized Revit API type\n  \nOther observations:\n\n- The reason the Appearance Assets work might be because the `AppearanceAssetElement` class is called out.\n- Appearance asset has the `AppearanceAsset` that seems analogous to the `StructuralAsset` and `ThermalAsset` classes.\n- However, there are no `StructuralAssetElement` or `ThermalAssetElement` classes.\n\nThe appearance asset also has a built-in category `OST_AppearanceAsset`, while the structural and thermal assets do not have any corresponding built-in category.\n\nThe links below are our references to date:\n\n-

class](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2016/b492ddf4-3058-8f9b-dfcc-8d5c4abb3605.htm)\n\n**Answer:** Structural and Thermal Assets are contained in `PropertySetElement` objects.\nSo, the line you wrote filtering for that should work.\nI checked in one of our templates and found 62 elements matching the filter.\n\n**Response:** Yes, thank you for your direction.\n\nThe reason zero elements were collected in our previous code sample was because we used the same collector instance several times over, both for the appearance assets and the property set.\n\nAs soon as we defined a new one `collector2`, it worked.\n\nThe  propertySet element hosts thermal and structural assets.\nHowever, there can be two property sets that have the same name (`Air`, for example), and one property set is dedicated to the structural, while the other to the thermal.\nYou cannot easily discern whether setting the property set element to a material will set the thermal or structural assets.\nEssentially, the property set is either thermal or structural when applied to a material.\n\nIt seems like the Revit UI categorizes property sets further into thermal and structural categories, while API access is limited.\n\nBelow is an attempt to try to categorize the propertyset elements.\nSome property sets return a null value when the thermal asset info is missing and vice-versa.\n\n<pre
