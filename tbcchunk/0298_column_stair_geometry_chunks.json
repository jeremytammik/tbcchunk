\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The issue with the columns is that the ones used in your own sample model file are standalone columns which do not join or intersect with any other elements.  \nIf a column or some other FamilyInstance element is joined to another element, its geometry might be changed by this operation.\nTherefore, each instance needs to maintain its own specific copy of the geometry.\n\n<p>On the other hand, a standalone column or FamilyInstance object that does not cut any other element can reuse the unmodified geometry defined by its family symbol.\nThis helps reduce file size, since it avoids creating and maintaining multiple copies of the same geometry.\n\n<p>We therefore need to check whether the family instance geometry contains any solid of its own.\nIf not, then it may be a standalone element, and we need to look at the symbol's geometry instead.\nThe standalone element type geometry is accessible through Geometry &gt; Instance &gt; SymbolGeometry. \nThe geometry retrieved then needs to be transformed from the symbol definition coordinate system to the instance coordinate system by applying the transform retrieved from Geometry &gt; Instance &gt; Transform.\n\n<p>Here is a pseudo code example demonstrating this:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"blue\">void</span> generateSingleElement( <span class=\"teal\">RvtElement</span> e )\n{\n  <span class=\"teal\">GeoElement</span> geo = e.get_Geometry( geomOption );\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( geo != <span class=\"blue\">null</span> )\n  {\n    <span class=\"teal\">GeometryObjectArray</span> arr = geo.Objects;\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">GeometryObject</span> obj <span class=\"blue\">in</span> arr )\n    {\n      <span class=\"teal\">Solid</span> geomSolid = obj <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Solid</span>;\n \n      <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( <span class=\"blue\">null</span> != geomSolid ) <span class=\"green\">//+</span>\n      {\n        <span class=\"green\">// get geometry from this solid</span>\n        <span class=\"green\">// ...</span>\n      }\n      <span class=\"blue\">else</span> <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( obj <span class=\"blue\">is</span> <span class=\"teal\">GeoInstance</span> )\n      {\n        <span class=\"teal\">GeoInstance</span> geoInst = obj <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">GeoInstance</span>;\n \n        <span class=\"teal\">GeoElement</span> geoElem = geoInst.SymbolGeometry;\n \n        <span class=\"teal\">Transform</span> transform = geoInst.Transform;\n \n        <span class=\"teal\">GeometryObjectArray</span> arr2 = geoElem.Objects;\n \n        <span class=\"green\">// use the same method as above to obtain </span>\n        <span class=\"green\">// the nested geometry. please don't </span>\n        <span class=\"green\">// forget to convert with the transform.</span>\n        <span class=\"green\">// ...</span>\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>The other problem you mention is filtering the columns which do not have the structural type StructuralType.Column. \nYou need to be aware of the fact that a StructuralType is only applicable to structural elements, for example structural columns and structural beams. \nNormal architectural column instances will not have a structural type assigned to them, so you cannot use this method to filter for them.\nIn that case, you should use the more general approach of filtering for the desired combination of FamilyInstance type and column category. \n\n\n<p>Regarding your issue with stairs, the solution is the same as for the columns.\n\n<p>Many thanks to Joe for handling this solution!\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
