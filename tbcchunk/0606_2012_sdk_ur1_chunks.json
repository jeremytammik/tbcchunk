Unfortunately, it references the Revit API assemblies from Revit 2012 MEP beta 2, which is bad. I updated the references to point to Revit Architecture 2012 instead and recompiled.\n<li>Some source files in Snoop\\CollectorExts have been updated: CollectorExtElement.cs, CollectorExtMEP.cs and CollectorExtMisc.cs. I have a further enhancement for the latter, which fixes the listing of container types in extensible storage and is currently available <a href=\"zip/CollectorExtMisc.cs\">here and here only</a>.\n<li>The REX SDK documentation in 'Read Me First.pdf' and 'Design Guidelines for Extensions SDK.pdf' has been updated, and a new file 'Development Guidelines for Extensions SDK.pdf' added.\n<li>In the samples solution SDKSamples2012.sln, the two missing sample projects ExternalCommandRegistration and RevitAddInUtilitySample have been added.\n<li>The MultithreadedCalculation idling call-back handler UpdateWhileIdling was fixed to accommodate the <a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/cascaded-events-and-renaming-the-active-document.html#2\">change in the Idling event handler sender argument</a>.\n<li>A sample model CompoundStructure.rvt has been added for the CompoundStructure sample.\n<li>The <a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/revitaddinutility.html#samples\">ExternalCommand2011 SDK sample</a> was renamed to ExternalCommand.\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<li>Opened SDKSamples2012.sln and recompiled all the samples. This requires either all three flavours of Revit to be installed in their default locations, or the use of RevitAPIDllsPathUpdater.exe, or some other trick to ensure that all the projects' Revit API assembly references are valid.\n<li>Updated the paths in RvtSamples.txt to match my system, i.e. globally replaced \"Z:\\SDK2012\\Samples\\\" by \"C:\\a\\lib\\revit\\2012\\SDK\\Samples\\\".\n<li>Set up one of the projects as a start-up project and specified it to start Revit.exe and load a specific simple project file to test.\n<li>Hit F5 to start debugging and verify that all is in order, especially that RevitLookup and RvtSamples load and execute all right.\n<li>This produces an error from RvtSamples saying that the CompoundStructure.dll assembly  cannot found. \nFor some reason, I have to go back to the solution and recompile that one separately again, all on its own. \n<li>Once that is done, it all works and no warnings are produced.\nI have seen this strange behaviour before...\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>\n<p>All in all, no huge changes, actually, and they all make sense  :-)\n\n<p>If you are interested, here are the <a href=\"zip/revit_2012_ur1_sdk_jt.zip\">files that differ</a> on my system after I have cleaned up and integrated everything, e.g. the differences that I wish to retain. \nThey include a very few minimal trivial fixes, and some more significant modifications to RvtSamples, which are for my personal use when testing.\n\n<h4>eTransmit for Revit</h4>\n<p>Another newly released piece of useful Revit functionality:\n\n<a href=\"http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/revit_etransmit/\">eTransmit for Revit</a>.\n\n<p>Easily share building information models using this Revit add-in application technology preview.\nWith eTransmit for Revit, you can:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copy and detach a Revit model and associated files to a single folder for internet transmission. This removes the typical error messages when you copy central files using the operating system.\n<li>Locate dependent files automatically and include them in the transmittal folder, reducing the possibility of error. All dependent files are automatically converted to use relative paths to ensure that the dependent files can be located by the model.\n<li>Choose to include related dependent files such as linked Revit models, CAD files, DWF markups, decal images, and external keynote files. You can transmit any Revit (.rvt) model that has been upgraded to Revit Release 2012.\n<li>Transmit models that are using file-based worksharing or server-based worksharing. eTransmit for Revit will also work with non-workshared Revit models.\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>Common uses for eTransmit:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Internal archiving\n<li>Sending deliverables to clients\n<li>Model exchange between consultants/partners\n<li>Model cleanup\n<li>Sharing models between disciplines\n</li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>It's <a href=\"http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/revit_etransmit/\">live on Labs</a>.\n\n<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Here is a snapshot of my current \n\n<a href=\"zip/RvtSamples_2011-08-09.txt\">RvtSamples.txt</a> today, \n\nAugust 9 2011, in answer to Rui Liu's comment below.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
