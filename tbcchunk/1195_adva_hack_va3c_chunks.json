How can we get it into the hands of the creators? We discuss some aspects of building 3D models and how to bring them to life on the web through a smooth streamlined pipeline, providing coders, designers and artists alike a strong and powerful web graphics tool. In addition to easily bringing your 3D models to the web, the viewer (based on three.js) includes an API allowing close interaction with the 3D model and querying element metadata. We demonstrate how WebGL experiences created with the Autodesk View and Data API engine can be elevated to the next level by making 3D models even more immersive and engaging with practical hands-on demonstrations and samples.</p><p>So much for the exciting (near) future perspective from the corporate CAD world.</p><p>Now, for a look at the other end of the spectrum:</p><a name=\"4\"></a>"
