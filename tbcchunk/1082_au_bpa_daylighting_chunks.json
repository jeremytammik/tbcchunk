The full raw values are still stored in the Revit Extensible Storage for export.</li>\n<li>User can hide and unhide AVF grids by level to make viewing and navigation easier in 3d section cuts.</li>\n<li>If the user has modified the \"LEED 2009…\" 3d view, the view is reset to defaults for the analysis run. Best practice is for user to make a copy of that view to create a custom view style.</li>\n<li>The plug-in can now handle multiple projects and multiple concurrent analyses in Revit. It is still required to keep a project open until the analysis is complete and data is downloaded from the cloud service.</li>\n<li>The user will now receive a message if a job fails for any reason, and the successful results will be downloaded.</li>\n</ul><p>You can download the technology preview from Autodesk Labs:\n\n<a href=\"https://beta.autodesk.com/callout/?callid=976EB2E05A1D46B5818473BDF2FAABC5\">\nDownload Daylighting Analysis Tool for Revit</a>.</p>"
