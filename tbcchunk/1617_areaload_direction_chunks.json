AutoCAD sports a Lisp interface, the ObjectARX C++ API, and the AutoCAD.NET .NET API.\n\nPlease refer to \nthe [AutoCAD developer centre at www.autodesk.com/developautocad](http://www.autodesk.com/developautocad) for\nmore information.\n\n> Is there an SDK or lightweight download for the Revit assemblies, or do I have to install Revit 2018 in parallel with 2017?\n\nYou may very well be able to run your Revit API add-in compiled for Revit 2017 unmodified on Revit 2018.\n\nYou would have to test, of course. It will only cause problems if you use Revit API calls in the Revit 2017 API that have been removed or modified in the Revit 2018 API. This is probably not the case.\n\nYou can download the Revit SDK only without a full Revit installation for the last couple of SDK releases from\nthe [Revit developer centre at www.autodesk.com/developrevit](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).\n\nHowever, you do not need the SDK at all to compile or run your add-in.\n\nThe SDK contains documentation and sample code, nothing else.\n\nAll you need to <b><i>compile</i></b> the add-in are the Revit API assemblies, e.g. RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll. These are included with the Revit product installation in the same folder as Revit.exe.\n\nAs you know, you need to launch Revit.exe to <b><i>run</i></b> the add-in.\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>Determining AreaLoad Direction and Value from its Force Vectors\n\nThis topic came up in \nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\non [direction and a value of `AreaLoad` from its 3 force vectors](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-do-i-find-a-direction-and-a-value-of-areaload-from-its-3/m-p/7660527):\n\n**Question:** There can be 2 or even 3 directions of `AreaLoad`: `ForceVector1`, `ForceVector2` and `ForceVector3`.\n\nBut Revit always draws the `AreaLoad` as directed to one direction.\n\nHow do I find that one direction?\n\nHow do I find a value of that one-directed load, at least at the points returned by the `GetRefPoint` method?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/AreaLoad2.png\" alt=\"AreaLoad\" width=\"491\"/>\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** Internally, all three forces are being stored as vectors and their length is the actual force. \n\nThe direction of the load is a vector that, simplified, equals `(F1+F2+F3).Normalize()` &ndash; this is not exposed.\n\nI will ask for a request to add an API property the force direction since, well, it is only logical to exist. \n\nMany thanks to Dragos Turmac and\nAlexander [@aignatovich](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1257478) Ignatovich\nfor helping to verify this.\n\n\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>ExportCncFab 2018\n\nBased on new requests, I updated\nthe [ExportCncFab add-in to export Revit wall parts to DXF or SAT for CNC fabrication](https://github.com/jeremytammik/ExportCncFab):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uNJ9RTppqoU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nHappily, no code modification was required at all for the update."
