Using these tools, you can navigate between multiple views and select objects, add them to the memory and when you're done, recall the selection. These tools work really well in combination with other selection tools under ***pyRevit*** tab. See images here for the tools and tooltips.\n\nEach tooltip shows the button name, the script that the button is associated with and a description of what the script does.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_mappendoverwrite.png\" alt=\"Memory append overwrite\" width=\"471\">\n</center>\n\nMemory read:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_mread.png\" alt=\"Memory read\" width=\"407\">\n</center>\n\nOther selection memory utilities:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_othermemory.png\" alt=\"Other selection memory utilities\" width=\"211\">\n</center>"

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4\"></a>An Even Quicker but Deeper Look at Setting up pyRevit\n\nNow let's take an even quicker and slightly deeper look at setting up [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit):\n\nIn it's simplest form, it's a folder filled with `.py` IronPython scripts for Revit.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_pyrevitfolder.png\" alt=\"pyRevit folder\" width=\"362\">\n</center>\n\nSince Revit itself does not provide an IronPython console, you\nneed [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell) to\nrun them.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_revitpythonshellconsole.png\" alt=\"RevitPythonShell console\" width=\"965\">\n</center>\n\nLet's say you have written a script that automatically designs amazing buildings and creates the Revit model and construction documents for it, and let's say you want to run this script as fast as you can and make a whole buncha money really quickly, but it takes time to open the command prompt every time, browse to the script file, open it and run it, so you naturally want something faster!\n\nIn order to make [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) more user friendly, it includes a helper script that finds all the other scripts and creates buttons for them in the Revit user interface.\nThis way. you can just click on the buttons instead of using the command prompt.\n\nThis script is appropriately called `__init__.py` and lives in\nthe [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) library root folder.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/pyrevit_initscript.png\" alt=\"pyRevit _init_ script\" width=\"379\">\n</center>\n\nWhat's neat about this is that the user interface buttons only store the address to each script.\nThe script is reloaded and run every time the user clicks on the button.\n\nThis means that you can change a script on the fly while Revit is running, and the next time you click on the button, Revit will run the modified script.\n\nBut how do you tell Revit to run this script during start-up?\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this:\n\n- The easy way:\n[RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell) has\nan option under `Configuration` to run an IronPython script at Revit start-up. Just download\nthe [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) repository,\nset the ***RevitPythonShell*** start-up script address to the file address of the `__init__.py` script, and restart Revit.\nVoila, the ***pyRevit*** tab appears.\n\n- The even easier way:\nDownload the setup package from\nthe [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) GitHub repository and install.\nDone! Launch your Revit and ***pyRevit*** will be there.\n\nIf you'd like to find out more about ***pyRevit*** and how to add your own scripts, visit the [pyRevit GitHub home page](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) and everything you want to know about it is provided.\n\nHappy scripting!\n\nMany thanks to Ehsan for creating, sharing, maintaining, and documenting pyRevit with and for us all!"
