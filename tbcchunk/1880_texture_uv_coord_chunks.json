    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Explaining Texture UV Mapping Using AVF\n\nA question was raised and partially discussed a while ago in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\non [`IExportContext` converting `UV` to the range (0,1)](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-iexportcontext-converting-uv-to-the-range-0-1/m-p/9908386).\n\nBack then, I summarised and preserved the initial part of this discussion in the blog post discussion\non [normalising UVs in custom exporter](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/07/revit-20211-update-and-normalising-custom-export-uv.html#3).\n\nNow Jason expanded on the question, the Revit development team admitted to the dearth of information in this area,\nprovided some hints, and, above all,\nRichard [RPThomas108](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1035859) Thomas once again\njumped in with a crucial and powerful solution to both answer the question and show how you can use the Analysis Visualisation Framework or AVF functionality for `UV` debugging to research and resolve this question yourself.\n\n**Question:**  I'm writing an exporter for Revit and encountered with a problem when exporting `UV`.\nWhen I call `PolymeshTopology.GetUV`, the coordinates given are often larger than 1.\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How can I convert them to the desired range (0,1)? Or how should I understand these UV values?\n2. Are they coordinates on the image? If so, how can I access the size of the image in IExportContext?\n\nTo give a concrete example: say I have a texture of size 4096x4096, the corresponding UV data I read in IExportContext is around 25, and the RealWorldScale from the UnifiedBitmapAsset is about 141.\nI cannot seem to be able to discern a formula or something...\n\nThe Building Coder article on [Faces](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/faces.html) helps somewhat.\n\nHowever, it explains UV as two variables that parameterize a face, but they are related to the structure of the face in 3D space, not how each vertex of the face is mapped to the bitmap.\nI'd appreciate it very much if you can elaborate on this, that is, how can I convert the `UV` coordinates returned by `PolymeshTopology.GetUV` to pixel coordinate on the image or in the range (0,1).\n\nThe article on [PolymeshTopology UVs](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/polymeshtopology-uvs/td-p/8641007) is relevant;\nhowever, the answer given is not detailed enough to actually solve the problem.\n\n**Answer:** Here is my current approach:\n\nThe PolymeshTopology.GetUV method returns a UV coordinate that represents the parameters of a face.\nTherefore, I guess they are related to the dimension of the face that they parameterize.\nThese UV coordinates can be converted to display units via UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits (deprecated, but anyway...), and, in my add-in, centimeters are used.\nSo, we have the UV in centimeters.\n\nThe next step is to obtain the size of the bitmap.\nThat is given by the properties with name UnifiedBitmap.TextureRealWorldScaleX/Y.\nThese values are actually given in inches, so you can call `UnitUtils.Convert` to convert them from `DisplayUnitType.DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES` to  `DisplayUnitType.DUT_CENTIMETERS`.\nIn fact, I found DisplayUnitType.DUT_FRACTIONAL_INCHES gives the same result; I don't know what's the difference.\nThe AssetPropertyDistance class actually has a DisplayUnitType property, which should be used instead of DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES.\n\nAfter that, the UV coordinates can be scaled to the range [0,1] or whatever.\n\nThis approach was preserved by The Building Coder in the note  on [normalising UVs in custom exporter](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/07/revit-20211-update-and-normalising-custom-export-uv.html#3).\n\n**Question:** Jason's follow-up request for more details that Richard helps resolve:\n\nThis is all a bit confusing, because UVs are generally a relative spatial coordinate system.\n\"Relative\" is the key word as they do not correspond to measurable distances.\nSo, why would there be a need to convert TextureRealWorldScaleX/Y to another unit, if normalization is ultimately x/y or y/x?\nHow is Revit calculating its UVs?\n\nIt seems crazy that the UVs provided are not usable UVs (unless the texture dimensions are 1:1) &ndash; the whole purpose of UVs is to allow us to ignore texture dimensions. All I understand is that it may make the Revit developers' lives easier, as it allows for interesting tiling dynamics when interchanging textures.\n\nIn any case, I attempted what I thought was a way to normalize given texture dimensions:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  normalize_multiplier = scaleX / (scaleY + ((scaleX - scaleY) / 2))\n</pre>\n  \nIf `scaleX` is 14 and `scaleY` 10 (inch, cm, it shouldn't really matter), then I see UVs that go from (0, 0) to (1.167, 0.833) and `normalize_multiplier` comes out to be 1.167.\nSo, (/, *) results in (1, 1).\n\nBut, unfortunately, that doesn't always work, and I see erroneous UVs elsewhere.\n\nSo, I need more information:\n\n1. What are the UVs we are getting from Revit &ndash; they are not classic UVs so what do they really represent?\n2. What is the appropriate algorithm to convert or normalize the UVs based on texture dimensions?\n3. Is there a function that already does this conversion?\n4. How does TextureRealWorldOffsetX/Y affect the UVs?\n5. How does TextureWAngle affect the UVs?\n\n**Answer:** I think this depends on the type of face; I find they are not always normalised from 0 to 1.\n\nYou can plot the `UV` coords on the surface using AVF; I believe the `UV` tends to follow the parameter of the curves around the edges of the face.\n\nSo, I believe, last time I checked, in a cylindrical face, the straight edges have ord related to raw parameter of curve (line), and the curved edges have normalised parameter of the arc, i.e., for the face on a vertical curved wall, the `V` was raw and the U was normalised (or the other way around). Sometimes, especially with cylindrical faces, the system is not oriented with `V` increasing in the same direction as `Basis.Z` (depends on face orientation). If you have a complete circle with two cylindrical faces, one will have `V` pointing downwards and the other pointing up to maintain face normal outwards.\n\nAnyway, my suggestion is to use AVF to understand how `UV` is applied to different types of faces.\n\nActually, I recalled wrong, results as below:\n\nGenerally, the `UV` is based on raw parameter of curved edges, but, for some faces, i.e., ruled face, it is normalised.\nBelow are some examples (note the direction of increase in all cases).\nThe below is based on difference between Face `BoundingBoxUV` `Max`/`Min`, dividing into 10 segments and adding the UV values to the `ValueAtPoint` collection.\nMany of the walls below are 9.8 feet high with base at 0.\n\n<center>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_planar_face_u.png\" alt=\"Planar face U\" title=\"Planar face U\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 763 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Planar face U</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_planar_face_v.png\" alt=\"Planar face V\" title=\"Planar face V\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 779 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Planar face V</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_ruled_face_u.png\" alt=\"Ruled face U\" title=\"Ruled face U\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 809 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Ruled face U</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_ruled_face_v.png\" alt=\"Ruled face V\" title=\"Ruled face V\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 772 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Ruled face V</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_cylinder_face_u.png\" alt=\"Cylinder face U\" title=\"Cylinder face U\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 684 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Cylinder face U</p>\n\n<img src=\"img/rt_avf_uv_cylinder_face_v.png\" alt=\"Cylinder face V\" title=\"Cylinder face V\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 701 -->\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">Cylinder face V</p>\n\n</center>\n\nThis seems logical to me, in that a Ruled face has to transition from one curve to another (opposite edges), so it makes sense for those two opposite curves to be normalised, so the points along it can be mapped to one another.\nImagine, otherwise you would have an arc at one edge opposing a line at the other (both with different lengths); you would have to normalise at some stage.\n\nAt the same time, other types of faces, such as cylindrical or planar, may be constructed with a curve projected in a given direction by a length, so raw parameters also seem more appropriate for that form of construction.\nRegarding cylindrical face, you can also see the U-Value are related to the parameter of the curve, i.e., that curved wall is obviously longer that 1.5ft if it is 9.8ft high (so, needs to be multiplied by its radius).\n\nI always prefer normalised curve parameters; they inherently tell you more and tell you everything when combined with a length and start point. I know what my preference would be, but I think we just get the leftovers of the internal geometry system.\n\nThe development team comments:\n\nRichard provides a great explanation by using AVF.\nWhen the UVs are in real world units, normalizing them can be accomplished on a per-object basis (if the wall is 9.8 feet high, divide by 9.8).\nHowever, ruled surface is already normalized.\nIt seems to me that the two cases can only be reconciled by taking into account vertex position.\nI wonder if normalization is the right approach here, since it would scale any texture to the size of the object, when in Revit the intention is to keep the detail in the texture (e.g., bricks) at a realistic scale relative to the object.\n\nSo, for general texturing, the AVF illustration provides all the answers, which is that most of the coordinates are in real units. The rest depends on what kind of texture mapping is needed.\nIt is possible to use the UVs of most Revit objects directly by normalizing them if needed (and paying attention to the special case of ruled surfaces).\nMore complex texturing may be possible for some imported objects.\nIf this is not enough, then the answer is to compute `UV` coordinates from vertex positions.\n\nFor what it's worth, the `PolymeshTopology` code and the internal code it uses have no description whatsoever of what the UVs are, never mind how they're supposed to be used.\nIt seems that anything related to texture mapping is sorely lacking in documentation.\n\nVery many thanks to Richard for his great `UV` debugging idea using AVF and the obvious conclusions he so clearly draws from that."
