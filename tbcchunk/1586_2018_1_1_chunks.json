In prior versions of Revit, the `Min` and `Max` coordinates would stay the same after assignment to the `CropBox` property. However, in Revit 2018 it appears that if the bounding box `Transform` does not match the View3D's crop box, Revit transforms the `Min` and `Max` values upon assignment to the `CropBox` property.\n\nHard to tell if this was a silent fix to incorrect behaviour in prior versions or if it's a bug in Revit 2018....\n\n**Report 2:** I have also had this problem in Revit 2018. One of our add-ins crops a 3D view to the extents of a section box, which has worked in all prior versions of Revit until now (2018). The crop seems to be off by a variable amount depending on the location of the section box but it's not particularly consistent. It tends to be off by about 10 feet or so in X and Y directions...\n\n**Report 3:** Section Box in Revit 2018 is indeed not working. I am having the same experience as fellas above. Code that used to work just fine in 2017 is not working in 2018. There are no errors or warnings, so I am not really sure what the issues are. My section box values look ok when I am debugging, transactions all complete, but when I open the view created, section box is off in space, even though its `BoundingBox` min and max would indicate that it's located properly. It's all very strange behaviour. \n\n**Answer:** Happily, as said, this issue is resolved by the new update.\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>CropBox Setting Workaround\n\n**Workaround:** Immediately before the release of the fix,\n[CaptainDan](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1003305) provided\nthe following workaround:\n\nJust thought I'd check in to see if anyone else tried the workaround (that worked for me at least) for this bug?\n \nWhat I originally did (and what worked in prior versions) was create a new `BoundingBoxXYZ`, set the min and max appropriately and assign this to the `CropBox` of the section.\n \nIn Revit 2018, after playing around with the same code, I found that as long I additionally set the transform of this new `BoundingBoxXYZ` to be the same transform that the original `CropBox` has, then the `Min` and `Max` don't change and appear correct. I haven't had any issues since this workaround and the tool that uses this code has been in use for some time now in our workflows without issue. Is everyone sure they're setting the `Transform` property appropriately?\n\n**Confirmation:** Thanks for the feedback, Dan; you are right, if I change:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  Dim oBBoxCropView As DB.BoundingBoxXYZ = V3D.CropBox\n</pre>\n\nTo the following, the extent is set correctly within my test sample, I will see what happens in my main application.\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  Dim oBBoxCropView As New DB.BoundingBoxXYZ\n  oBBoxCropView.Transform = V3D.CropBox.Transform\n</pre>\n\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>Revit 2018.1 API Documentation Online\n\nAs [Gui Talarico](http://www.gtalarico.com) pointed out in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) forum thread\non [Revit 2018.1 API documentation](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-2018-1-documentation/m-p/7388174):\n\n> [RevitApiDocs.com](http://www.revitapidocs.com) has been updated to include the latest 2018.1 API:</br></br>\n> <center>[<b>www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1</b>](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1)</center>\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revitapidocs_2018_1.png\" alt=\"RevitApiDocs.com covers Revit 2018.1 API\" width=\"762\"/>\n</center>\n\nEver so many thanks to Gui for maintaining this invaluable resource!"
