\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You are right, the Length is read-only.\nYou can use the LocationCurve.Curve instead, which is write enabled. \nThe following code snippet shows how to move the point and update the location:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"green\">// get the current wall location</span>\n \n  <span class=\"teal\">LocationCurve</span> wallLocation = myWall.Location \n    <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">LocationCurve</span>;\n \n  <span class=\"green\">// get the points</span>\n  <span class=\"teal\">XYZ</span> pt1 = wallLocation.Curve.get_EndPoint( 0 );\n  <span class=\"teal\">XYZ</span> pt2 = wallLocation.Curve.get_EndPoint( 1 );\n \n  <span class=\"green\">// change one point, e.g. move 1000 mm on X axis</span>\n \n  pt2 = pt2.Add( <span class=\"blue\">new</span> XYZ( mmToFeet( 1000 ), 0, 0 ) );\n \n  <span class=\"green\">// create a new LineBound</span>\n  <span class=\"teal\">Line</span> newWallLine = app.Create.NewLineBound( \n    pt1, pt2 );\n \n  <span class=\"green\">// update the wall curve</span>\n  wallLocation.Curve = newWallLine;\n</pre>\n<h4>More From Ko Tao</h4>\n<p>I am still on Ko Tao. \nYou may be surprised to hear that one of the reasons for me to come here was to practice Italian.\nMy friend Daniela invited me to join her here for a diving holiday.\nI took a \n\n<a href=\"http://www.cmas.org\">\nCMAS</a> diving exam \n\nin swimming pools with a final test in the Zurich Lake several years ago, and never ever made any use of it by going diving in natural waters, and I also wanted to continue practicing Italian, so it sounded like a perfect idea.\nOnce here, we even met her friend Maurizio, another diver, more or less by coincidence, so now the three of us often hang out.\nHere are Daniela and Maurizio in Hin Wong Bay, where we went for a very nice snorkelling tour:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Maurizio and Daniela in Hin Wong Bay\" src=\"img/daniela_506_maurizio_daniela_in_hin_wong_bay.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>In that bay I had my first very impressive experience of swimming in the middle of a huge school of tiny fish, maybe a couple of hundred thousand of them, several cubic metres, swirling around me in all directions, like a single living mass.\n\n<p>And here is Daniela watching some chickens in front of the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.divingcourseskohtao.com\">\nAlvaro Diving</a> office \n\nin Alok Baan Kao Bay with the Buddha Rock in the background:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Daniela with chickens and the Buddha Rock\" src=\"img/daniela_516_chicken_daniela_buddha_alvaro_chalok_baan_kao.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Finally, here is a sweet little hut on a boat right next to the hut we were staying in until yesterday:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Hut on a boat\" src=\"img/daniela_509_hut_on_a_boat.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Now we moved to a more tranquil spot at Jul Julea Beach, away from noise and music and bars and people.\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
