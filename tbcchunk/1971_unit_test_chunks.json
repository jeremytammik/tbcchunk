Still, I'll briefly reiterate:\n\n- What is the best way to learn in this case?\n\nStart by exploring the Revit UI. You already have. Gain some basic understanding of .NET and C#, of you plan to work in C#. That should be doable in a couple of hours or a couple of days, depending on you. Then, work through the Revit API getting started material. There are walkthroughs, video tutorials, numerous YouTube introductions, hundreds of options. Many have been mentioned and discussed here in the forum in the past.\n\n- Where can I ask and find information?\n\nPlease work through the getting started material before asking any questions. If you encounter problems with the getting started material, please search for existing answers. I guarantee that you will not have a problem that has not already been discussed and solved here in the past.\n\n- How much usually is time to learn such process?\n\nDays, weeks, and years. Depends how far you wish to go. A proficient programmer can understand the system and have a non-trivial macro up and running within hours.\n\n- Do I need to learn the whole C# language or just the Revit API?\n\nThere is no good way to use half a programming language.\nYou have to learn and understand the entire .NET environment.\nThat can be programmed in C# or in other languages as well.\n\nAll of this information has been presented hundreds of times in the past, so please search thoroughly for answers before raising any new questions.\n\nThank you! Good luck and have fun!"

Your comment here in the discussion forum might be overlooked.\n\n**Answer 2:** The documentation for [`FabricationConfiguration` `GetAllMaterials`](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/f8e1ab05-467f-6ee6-3103-052d27e8af74.htm) says:\n\n> If a part is passed, only returns materials which are valid for the part, otherwise returns all materials.\n\nDoes it return all materials if you pass it null?\n\n**Response:** Yes, it's returning a lot of material ids if provided 'null' and hopefully these are all the materials available.\n\nFeeling like, how did I miss it out... :-)\n\nThanks a lot for pointing it out.\n\n**Answer:** Wow!

Is that right? \n\n**Answer:** I believe so.\nI don't 100% understand what you are asking, but I will second that speckle's Revit unit test is the best available test framework for Revit that we've found.\nYou can run test functions using the speckle UI, and you don't have to test a full external command &ndash; you can test individual methods.\n\nNote that you still have to open Revit to use it, as I haven't seen a Revit Test Framework that can get around that &ndash; as far as I know, Revit has to be open to have access to its API, which is required to test anything that uses and Revit API calls.\nWe've used Speckle a bit at our company, but eventually moved away from it in support of developing our own Revit Unit Test framework that better suited our needs and process.\n\n**Response:** Cool vid!\nI think it's awesome that you are developing your own!\nI think more Revit devs should be more focused on testing to ensure better and more stable applications!\nIs that test class calling the Revit API?\nI would be amazed if you found a way to get that working with the Revit API but outside of Revit &ndash; if so lemme know how!\n\nOur company actually ended up making our own Revit Test Framework to better suit our needs, and we'd like to make it open source one day!\nHere's a screenshot:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/daniel_unit_test_window_1.png\" alt=\"Unit test\" title=\"Unit test\" width=\"600\"/>  <!-- 648 × 823 -->\n</center>\n\nUnit test report:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/daniel_unit_test_window_2.png\" alt=\"Unit test\" title=\"Unit test\" width=\"500\"/>  <!-- 895 × 678  -->\n</center>\n\n**Response:** I was referring to the below example where on line 4 there is a method calling a Revit model from the solution folder.\n\nI could be wrong but looks like there is a method to load RVT model and execute API methods directly (line 7), meaning I don't have to open a new Revit session to run tests: [github.com/specklesystems/xUnitRevit](https://github.com/specklesystems/xUnitRevit):\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;[Fact]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">void</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#74531f;\">WallsHaveVolume</span>()\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#1f377f;\">testModel</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;GetTestModel(<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;walls.rvt&quot;</span>);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#1f377f;\">doc</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;xru.OpenDoc(testModel);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#1f377f;\">walls</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">new</span>&nbsp;FilteredElementCollector(doc).WhereElementIsNotElementType().OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Walls).ToElements();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8f08c4;\">foreach</span>&nbsp;(var&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#1f377f;\">wall</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8f08c4;\">in</span>&nbsp;walls)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#1f377f;\">volumeParam</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;wall.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.HOST_VOLUME_COMPUTED);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.NotNull(volumeParam);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assert.True(volumeParam.AsDouble()&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doc.Close(<span style=\"color:blue;\">false</span>);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n</pre>\n\n**Answer:** Yes, I believe Speckle provides methods for you to load and switch between Revit files, among other utilities.\nHowever, I also though speckle tests needed to be run via the speckle test ui, which is a revit addin &ndash; so you have to open that to run the tests.\nI could be mistaken, as I haven't used speckle in a little while!\n\nHere's a link to a [speckle unit test blog post](https://speckle.systems/blog/xunitrevit) &ndash; I think this is the framework we are talking about? It mentioned three parts, one of which is a Revit addin that actually runs the tests.\n\n**Response:** I see, well, this is pritty much still better IMO compared to the alternatives, but I wish there was a framework to execute tests without launching a new Revit session, otherwise it is very restricting in terms of the machine specs I have to run the tests on.\n\n**Answer:** Without Revit open is not possible I guess, but you could use\nthe Autodesk Platform Services (APS) (ex Forge) [Design Automation API](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview/) to\nrun some tests.\n\nI created a demo doing so, [ricaun &ndash; Forge Hackathon 2022 &ndash; demo](https://youtu.be/EL5uJm_Nj8g).\n\nThe Test part is the missing key in my workflow; I was thinking to add a UI for testing in the AppLoader plugin, but makes more sense to use the Test Explorer in Visual Studio 2022, just need to create an IPC between Revit and Visual Studio.\n\n**Response 1:** This is REALLY cool, thanks for sharing! I like the idea of using Forge, and that does seem to be where Autodesk wants to head in the future.\n\nMany thanks to ricaun for this important research and explanation!"
