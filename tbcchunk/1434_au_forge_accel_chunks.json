If your application is accepted, you will spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs &ndash; with the direct face-to-face help of ADN DevTech and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View & Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs, as well as a number of exciting new APIs that will be launched at the conference. A full list of APIs is provided at [forge.autodesk.com](http://forge.autodesk.com).\n\nTo apply for this program, please submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you'd like to work on and how it will make use of the Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available at [autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply).\n\nProposals for suitable projects will be accepted as they come in, so don't wait too long!\n\nWe are looking forward very much to receiving your application.\n\nWe are deliberately scheduling this accelerator the week directly after Forge DevCon, so you can come for the conference, spend the weekend at the hackathon (details to be announced soon), and then attend the accelerator, all in one trip.\n\nWhy not register for the [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) right now as well?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/forge_accelerator.png\" alt=\"Forge Accelerator\" width=\"400\">\n</center>"
