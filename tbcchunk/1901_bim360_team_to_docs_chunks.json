It’s a Revit plugin with integration of Forge DM, mainly target for Revit developer. Currently I put it under my personal repo at https://github.com/JohnOnSoftware/forge-rcw.file.migration-revit.addon, but I am thinking to move it to https://github.com/ADN-DevTech or https://github.com/autodesk-Forge, I think https://github.com/ADN-DevTech is better place, but your ideas?\n  Here is the blog of this sample: https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/migrate-revit-worksharing-models-bim-360-team-bim-360-docs-powered-revit-2022-cloud\n  Yes, the goal of this sample is to demonstrate the process to migrate Revit cloud worksharing models from BIM 360 Team to BIM 360 Docs, Forge related, but the core API is within Revit. Will make it clear if we put under Autodesk-Forge.\n  And for your question, normally, our tools use the process environment variable, set the environments within the command line before running the application.\n  But for the Revit plugin, since this should be running within Revit, it’s not user-friendly to running Revit every time from the command line with process environment variables setup, using user environment variable could solve this problem to make it easy, and only the user can get the environment variables…\n  The instruction for the 3 different environment variable type is: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environmentvariabletarget?view=netframework-4.8\n  zw_bim360docs_migration.png\n\ntwitter:\n\nRevit 2022 migrates BIM360 Team to Docs using the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon http://autode.sk/rvt2022migratedocs\n\nRevitLookup migrated to Revit 2022.
