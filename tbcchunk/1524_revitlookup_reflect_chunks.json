For the past few months I have been making some rather serious modifications to the source code in order to more fully explore every object that the API has to offer. This has primarily been to supplement my own add-in creation but also to get a better understanding of the underlying types of the API. Furthermore, I wanted to make RevitLookup work for any version of Revit, meaning I have been doing the majority of my changes via reflection.\n\n> I would like to contribute these changes to the project. Given how drastic the changes were, I wanted to give you a copy and see how you wanted to handle this.\n\nPlease refer to the [commit summary](#4) below for more information on the changes made to individual modules.\n\nHere is a screen snapshot snooping the properties of a roof using the `Reflection` enhanced version of RevitLookup:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revitlookup_reflect.png\" alt=\"RevitLookup using Reflection\" width=\"777\"/>\n</center>"

I don't particularly like handling separate projects so I resolve to wrap older commands and check to make sure they exist with whatever version of the API you are using and then choose the correct one. The version you are using will work as is for 2017 (from the most recent source code on github) and if you change the references to 2017 you can build and compile it fine as well.\n\n> Most of the additions from other users are completely obsolete at this point. Given everything available to the API object is now loaded directly from the assembly, we shouldn't be missing any information. \n\n> One feature that this does change is it simply gives you the name of the method or property directly from the library, whereas you were originally naming these specifically. I think I prefer this method because most of us using RevitLookup are doing it in order to do something else with the API, and it helps to have the exact name of the property and method when we go to start programming.\n\n> That handles most of the major changes. There are definitely some minor ones that I am missing but I think this is a good start."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"6\"></a>Snoop / CollectorExts\n\nRemoved all modules spare two, the non abstract one which is the main worker of loading information via reflection. In general, I felt like it was a lot of code which needed to be specifically typed out in order to get parameters and method values that were already available. The new worker is very simple: when the collect event is called, we pass the object to the worker, the worker determines which types the object is associated with and places those in a list. Then we loop through each type and collect properties and methods that meet certain requirements, for each type:\n\n- Properties have to have a get method and they can't require any parameters to be passed in.\n- Methods cannot require any parameters to be passed in and they also can't have a void return type.\n\nWe avoid making any changes to the document by invoking the methods in a try statement, and given we are outside of a transaction we catch any error that it would throw due to that. I did a simple (and I mean simple) check of what parameters we have already seen so that we don't continue to log duplicate information in the snoop dialog. I considered leaving all the properties and methods in for every type but it made the list of information very long and I wasn't sure how much I benefited from showing all that information.\n\nCertain specific properties and methods that I wanted, such as element geometry and boundary segments, I had to add on a case by case basis but even this is much more efficient because we still don't require separate methods for each type. We can continue to update the list of specific properties and methods that have parameter inputs as an ongoing work."
