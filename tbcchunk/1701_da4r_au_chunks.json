It will allow developers to access the “business logic” of Revit on the cloud. Like Design Automation API for AutoCAD, developers can create client applications, which speak to the Revit engine via REST API.\n\nDevelopers will be able to automate existing workflows or create new cloud workflows. Because Design Automation API for Revit is a Forge service, we can take advantage of other Forge services to easily connect our applications together.\n\nWhat are some examples of what the service can do?\n\nThere are many options falling under three major workflows: Create, Extract, and Modify.\n\n- Create\n    - Convert from a third-party format to RVT/RFA\n    - Generate documentation from a specification\n    - Create families from a catalogue\n- Extract\n    - Put data into a format Revit doesn’t natively support\n    - Share model info with consultants who don’t have Revit\n    - Create daily model reports\n- Modify\n    - Design option generation\n    - Automatically replace out-of-date content\n    - Fix common modelling mistakes"

You can use any language, which can make REST calls. This client application will also do any “front-end” work you need – displaying UI to an end-user, for example.\n\nIn addition to the client application, we will create one or more Revit add-ins to execute against the Revit engine. They will be uploaded to the Design Automation service and your client application will refer to them when invoking the service. They can be kept private or public depending on what you want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/as226079_da4r_1.png\" alt=\"Architecture of Revit.io\" width=\"505\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%\"><i>Fig.1 Architecture of Revit.io</i></p>\n</center>"

A nickname lets you create a friendly, easy-to-read string that can be used in place of the long Forge App ClientId.\n- Alias: An alias is a label to a specific version of app or activity.

Once the upload process is done the Web App will send a copy of the Revit file to the Revit.io engine and trigger the Families extraction add-in. As soon as DA4R finishes the extraction, it will save the Families into folders named after their Category names. As the DA4R only will allow us to get the result of our processing in the form of single file, then we need to zip all the folders into a single archive.\n\nThe archived categorized families will then be uploaded to an AWS bucket where we will make benefit from the Amazon S3 services and the Lamda functions. After the upload is complete, we will use Lambda function to trigger an extraction process, which will unzip the contents into another bucket. Whenever the extraction is finished, another Lambda function will be triggered to upload the extracted families into their related buckets in the Forge associated buckets. Applying the corporate standard to the families like file name convention, validating the families or testing the parameters can take place at any stage after the extraction, either by triggering another Lambda function or at your Web App after the Families are uploaded to the Forge buckets.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/as226079_da4r_4.png\" alt=\"Revit.io integration with cloud-platforms\" width=\"712\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%\"><i>Fig.4 Revit.io integration with cloud-platforms</i></p>\n</center>"

By using a simple ML algorithm, you can create a Suggestion System which is able to recognize the Families of the same geometry but different in parameters. That way the system is able to do versioning and ask you which version you want to keep or you need to keep both or merge them into one.\n\nThe ML algorithm can recognize the type of the project from the EIR and then suggest you the right Families to include in your project.\n\nIn our portal user can drag and drop or simply select the required Families for the next project into a Forge viewer; User can also reposition and change the orientation of each Family.\n\nOnce you finish the laying out, you can execute the DA Workitem that will create a Revit template file with all the positioned Families at the same location.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/as226079_da4r_5.png\" alt=\"Family Catalogue created by Revit.io\" width=\"700\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%\"><i>Fig.5 Family Catalogue created by Revit.io</i></p>\n</center>"

The evolution of the AEC industry dictates a shift in which companies need to adapt to such changes. The recent development and deployment of Building Information Modelling (BIM), for example, emphasizes the importance of such endeavours.\n\nBy finding a way to glue the new technologies with the BIM standards, we can say that Revit.io is the best technology to do so. As this technology is still evolving we expect more and more in the future to come.\n\nVery many thanks to Mustafa and Marc for preparing this material and sharing their exciting new experience!"
