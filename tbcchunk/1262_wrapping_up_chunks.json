We are very curious about the REST API and have a couple of questions about it:</p><ul>\n<li>Is the REST API read-only or can the users edit data through the REST API? For example, what if a municipality has a model for a city plan and wants to gather comments about the plan from the citizens. It would then be great if we could, through the REST API, grab an object from the model, for example a surface, publish it, and make the attributes on the object editable to the user. We have been working with mapguide-rest and the GeoREST API for this type of editing and publishing.</li>\n<li>Will we be able to publish the model through a server or is it limited to Autodesk 360?</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Thanks for reaching out. We are indeed releasing an InfraWorks 360 REST API, which is currently available as part of our Beta program. The API is used to read model data, such as lists and detailed element information. The models are published using the desktop client of InfraWorks 360, like any other model, by syncing it to the cloud, from where it becomes accessible through the API.</p><p>Here are some links with more information:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2014/11/infraworks-360-rest-api-at-autodesk-university.html\">The InfraWorks 360 REST API at Autodesk University</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2014/10/importing-alignment-from-infraworks-360-to-civil-3d.html\">Importing alignments from InfraWorks 360 to Civil 3D</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/infrastructure/2014/05/infraworks-360-rest-api-tech-preview-available.html\">InfraWorks 360 REST API Tech Preview</a></li>\n</ul><p>Please get in touch with Augusto if you would like to use the InfraWorks 360 API so we can discuss and ensure we provide all you need.</p><a name=\"5\"></a>"
