Then after the work is complete the add-in will generate a report of the changes that have been made or problems it ran into.</p><p>With other add-ins I would always just contain transactions inside using blocks, and wrap that in a try catch block. However, with this add-in I'm going to end up with a rather complicated nesting of transaction groups, transactions, and sub transactions.</p><p>If something goes wrong during this process, I would like to be able to report back to the user exactly what went wrong, and what state the model is currently in. Thus, I'm trying to understand the various ways the transaction structure can fail, and how to check for these failures.</p><p>It seems like there are a number of places where these actions could potentially fail. Each Start and Commit method returns the actual status of the transaction, which as I understand may be something other then Started or Committed.</p><p>Assume I have single sub transaction in a transaction that's also in a transaction group. Each of these transaction levels needs to be started and committed. So that's six different places that could potentially return an incorrect status.

That blog post helps a lot. As I understand it containing a transaction in a using blog ensures that the transaction is not left open. The using block will also automatically dispose, and thus roll back the transaction before exiting the block. So I don't need to worry about manually rolling back a transaction if something fails.</p><p>However, using blocks do not catch exceptions, so I would need a try catch block around the using to catch and log any exceptions thrown. Keep in mind my code is running without user interaction so there will not be anyone to see error dialog. Any errors that occur I will just need to log. So consider the following code.</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">try</span>\n  {\n    <span class=\"blue\">using</span> (<span class=\"blue\">var</span> trans = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>(doc, <span class=\"maroon\">\"Transaction Name\"</span>))\n    {\n      trans.Start();\n \n      <span class=\"green\">///////////DO SOMETHING TO THE MODEL///////////////////</span>\n \n      trans.Commit();\n    }\n  }\n  <span class=\"blue\">catch</span> (<span class=\"teal\">Exception</span> exp)\n  {\n    logger.Error( <span class=\"maroon\">\"Exception occurred during transaction\"</span>, exp );\n  }\n</pre><p>What if trans.Start fails and returns something other then Started? I'm assuming an exception would be thrown later when the code tries to modify the document outside the transaction or the code attempts to commit a transaction that was not started. In this case my code would still catch the error.</p><p>However, could trans.Commit returns something other then Committed? If so then it would not be throwing an exception, and thus the code above would not log any error. In this case I would need to check the return value of Commit and log an error if it returns something other then Committed.</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">try</span>\n  {\n    <span class=\"blue\">using</span>( <span class=\"blue\">var</span> trans = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>( doc, <span class=\"maroon\">\"Transaction Name\"</span> ) )\n    {\n      trans.Start();\n \n      <span class=\"green\">///////////////////////////////////////////////////////</span>\n      <span class=\"green\">///////////DO SOMETHING TO THE MODEL///////////////////</span>\n      <span class=\"green\">///////////////////////////////////////////////////////</span>\n \n      <span class=\"blue\">var</span> commitStatus = trans.Commit();\n \n      <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( commitStatus != <span class=\"teal\">TransactionStatus</span>.Committed )\n      {\n        logger.Warn( <span class=\"maroon\">\"Transaction \"</span> + trans.GetName()\n          + <span class=\"maroon\">\" did not commit.

    "local_header_href": "#1-returning-status",
    "chunk_text": "<h4>1. Returning Status</h4><p>Although all the actionable methods of transaction phases (transactions, sub-transaction, and transaction groups) do return status, it is not always necessary to test them and I must admit I do not always do it either (and still feel my code is quite robust). I can share some ground rules (of mine :-).</p><ul>\n<li>The Start method rarely fails and I myself  practically never test it in my own managed code. In fact it may be possible that when called from the API those methods never return anything but Started. If they could not, they would throw instead (certain rare exceptional situations exists.) It needs to be understood that we (Revit developers) use these very same classes and methods, and we have some additional workflows available to us during which the Start method may return other status. I do not have a direct proof for my claim, but I believe API users do not need to worry about the status returning from Start methods.</li>\n<li>Sub-transaction practically never return status other than the one expected for each respective method. It means that if the workflow is legal (i.e. the sub-transaction is within a modifiable document), the Start, Commit, and RollBack method will return what they should. I do not think I bother with testing the return values. I may have some asserts messages there instead to catch bugs, but if any of the methods fail on a sub-transaction my code will rather deal with an exception that will be thrown sooner or later. However, I would not catch exceptions specifically from sub-transaction methods. I mean do not immediately catch them (as in the user's sample below). The user should understand that if a sub-transaction fail with an exception it is very likely the users own fault (a bug) and should be addressed.</li>\n<li>Commit, RollBack and Assimilate methods called on a transaction group have a very high probability of succeeding, providing there are called at appropriate times and circumstances (if they are not, they will throw.) I may be not as careless with transaction groups as I am with sub-transactions, but I definitely do not go crazy about testing the results of neither the finishing methods. Again, I would probably be inclined to use an Assert instead.</li>\n<li>Transaction is certainly the class for which testing the results of methods programmers need to be rather cautious. It is unlikely that RollBack would fail (meaning: it should return RolledBack), but it is reasonably likely for a Commit to return other status than Committed. The programmer is definitely encouraged to check the status, particularly if the transaction is not the end of the model-modifying action. Programmers (both external and internal) should test the status and take appropriate actions. For example, if the status is RolledBack, than perhaps something else needs to be undone too. Or if the status is Pending (not too common in the API, though possible), the programmer must not do anything to the model as long as the transaction is in the 'pending' state.</li>\n</ul>"

    "local_header_href": "#2-transactioncommit",
    "chunk_text": "<h4>2. Transaction.Commit</h4><p>This is specific to the Transaction objects only and to the Commit method specifically. It needs to be understood that returning status other than Committed from the Commit method cannot always be seen as a failure (per se) of the commitment process. It is perfectly expected and legal to receive the RolledBack status instead, because it might be a result of the end-user's actions (or other applications' updaters or failure handlers.) Rolling back instead of committing is simply Revit's way to inform the transaction owner that there were problems with the model, thus the changes could not be accepted. Those problems might have been caused by the transaction's owner as well as by other applications; it is not always possible to determine the exact cause. However, as I said, it is not an unexpected situation and it does not always need to be reported as an error. (Unless, of course, it is in unit testing when the testing application 'knows' the transaction should commit.)</p><p>Handling this case may vary depending on the complexity of the action. If it is a simple action (e.g., opening a transaction, making few modifications, and closing the transaction) I would not even worry about reporting that Commit did not return Committed. In most cases it should be already apparent if not obvious to the end user. (There would be a mini-warning, or failure handling dialog). In cases of rather complex actions with multiple transactions the programmer needs to be more cautious, because one change of the model may depend on the success of some preceding action. For example, if I have two complex changes to the model and each of the changes is in an isolated transaction, I may need to know whether or not the first transaction committed before I attempt to start the second transaction. Not because the second transaction would not start, but rather because the second transaction (and the change within) may no longer make sense. For example, I may do:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">using</span>(<span class=\"teal\">TransactionGroup</span> tgroup = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">TransactionGroup</span>(document))\n  {\n    tgroup.Start();\n    <span class=\"blue\">using</span>(<span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span> trans = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>(document))\n    {\n      trans.Start(<span class=\"maroon\">\"Change 1\"</span>);\n \n      MakeMyChanges(document);\n \n      <span class=\"blue\">if</span>(trans.Commit() != <span class=\"teal\">TransactionStatus</span>.Commited)\n      {\n         tgroup.RollBack();\n         <span class=\"blue\">return</span> err_code; <span class=\"green\">// or throw an exception</span>\n      }\n \n      trans.Start(<span class=\"maroon\">\"Change 2\"</span>);\n \n      MakeMyOtherChanges(document);\n \n      <span class=\"blue\">if</span>(trans.Commit() != <span class=\"teal\">TransactionStatus</span>.Commited)\n      {\n         tgroup.RollBack()\n         <span class=\"blue\">return</span> err_code; <span class=\"green\">// or throw an exception</span>\n      }\n    }\n    tgroup.Commit();\n  }\n</pre><p>Note: the code above assumes that the Pending status may not be returned from the Commit method. Otherwise a more complicated implementation would be needed. (As I said earlier, transaction Pending is not very common workflow in external applications. It is a subject for its own dedicated discussion.)</p>"

By which I mean: As long as I can I write my code in a way that makes me believe my calling those methods should not cause exceptions. Thus my exception-handling would be on a higher level somewhere up the code chain. Perhaps it depends in each programmer's style, but I am a believer in a defensive and cautious programming – I want to get an exception only as a real surprise; if I can avoid it I write the code so exceptions are not thrown at me. For example, if it is unclear whether a document is currently modifiable or not, I test it before I attempt to start a sub-transaction. (And if it is not I'd throw my own exception back at the caller who called my sub-transaction using method.)</p><p>So, yes, my recommendation for catching exceptions would be much like the user's second and third sample (the one with the Logger in the Catch.)</p><p>As a response to the user's code: It is a ground rule for the API programmers that if they receive an Invalid Operation exception (or Invalid Argument exception), they may consider debugging their code and fix the problem so Revit would not throw the exception. These two exception kinds is Revit's response to programmers not using the API properly. We in the Revit API group certainly strive to provide such an API that allows programmers to test before attempting to do something invalid with the API. That is, I believe, also the case with the transaction API. We document the circumstances in which the methods may fail and we provide methods to test whether or not such circumstances are currently met.</p>"
