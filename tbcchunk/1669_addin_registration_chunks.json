You can see this very recommendation in\nthe [developer guide instructions on Add-in Registration](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Add_In_Integration_Add_in_Registration_html):\n \n- `VendorId`: A unique vendor identifier that may be used by some operations in Revit (such as identification of extensible storage). This must be unique, and thus we recommend using a reversed version of your domain name, for example, com.autodesk or uk.co.autodesk.\n \n**Question:**  Does this need to be registered with Autodesk somewhere? \n \n**Answer:** No.\n\nYou can use any symbol you like, and you are responsible yourself for its uniqueness.\n\nThere used to be a different system, the *Autodesk Registered Developer Symbol, <b>RDS</b>*, limited to four characters and registered with Autodesk. That system was invented by Jeremy Tammik in the timeframe of ADGE, the AutoCAD Developers Group Europe, in the early 1980's. It had to be short and somewhat user compatible, since it was included in numerous AutoCAD symbol names, which were limited to 32 characters at that time. Therefore, it required a centralised registration agency. It has since been terminated.\n\nUsing the inverted Internet URL requires no registration, since the real Internet URL is unique in itself."
