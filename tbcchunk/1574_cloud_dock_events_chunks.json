The goal is to understand the partner application usage of these APIs and make sure to enable a smooth transition to the new APIs.   \n \nHere are the details:\n \n- <b>Point Cloud Engine API</b> &ndash; The functionality of this API is to provide access to different kinds of point clouds to Revit. Autodesk ReCap Pro provides similar functionality with enhanced capabilities. We would like to hear your feedback about how this API is currently being used and any of your concerns of the API change.\n- <b>Dockable Pane</b> &ndash; This is a user interface API that allows a third-party application to add a custom pane to the Revit docking window system. It may be combined with additional UI features such as drag and drop, selection and events. We are working on a modernized version of this feature.\n \nIf you are interested in discussing and testing the new APIs, working closely with the Revit product team, please send an e-mail to:\n\n- [Catherine.Liu@autodesk.com](mailto:catherine.liu@autodesk.com) re: *Revit Point Cloud Engine API Alpha Pilot*\n- [Guofeng.Zhang@autodesk.com](mailto:guofeng.zhang@autodesk.com) re: *Dockable Pane Alpha Pilot*"
