    "chunk_text": "<h4>Proposal Abstract</h4><p>A complete generic cloud-based graphical and non-graphical 2D Revit BIM editor. It stores 2D plan view graphics and non-graphical data from a Revit building information model (BIM) in a NoSQL cloud database, implements a fully generic and completely portable editor for both graphical and non-graphical BIM information on any mobile device and supports full round-trip editing with real-time updates from the mobile device through the cloud database to the BIM. This includes the implementation of a framework for extracting and managing arbitrary data from BIM element properties and parameters, storing it in JSON format in a NoSQL cloud database, displaying it to the user in a flexible manner, providing editing facilities, updating the cloud database from modifications on the mobile device and synchronising the BIM model with the cloud database in real-time. This is a continuation of my TS 2013 project, a cloud-based round-trip real-time of a simplified 2D view with no support for non-graphical metadata. My TS 2014 proposal is to reimplement the whole application from scratch, taking additional real-world requirements from external application developers into account to implement a powerful, flexible, generic tool that will be reused by external developers and significantly expand, enhance and simplify their work to grow the cloud-based Autodesk ecosystem.</p><p>Here is a suggested workflow that I may or may not be able to implement in time:\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Revit, select the plan views and specific categories to export, e.g., walls, furniture, etc.</li>\n<li>Export both non-graphical data, e.g. properties and parameters, plus graphical data to 2D SVG.</li>\n<li>Import the graphical and non-graphical data into a NoSQL cloud database using the Revit unique id as a common key.</li>\n<li>Display the 2D plans in a graphical viewer in a web browser.</li>\n<li>Implement picking an element in the viewer, selecting it and displaying a modal window with non-graphical data.</li>\n<li>The non-graphical data can be edited and the selected element location modified by dragging, updating the cloud database.</li>\n<li>Update the Revit BIM model from the cloud database, including both graphical and non-graphical data.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This has a the following important advantages over the current simplified 2D room editor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a real use case and strong need for such functionality; almost any application developer could make use of such a component in one, several, or all typical workflows.</li>\n<li>Non-graphical data could be handled in a generic, customisable, flexible manner, in addition to the current graphical location and rotation functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wish me luck getting all of this up and running in time.</p>\n<p>I look forward to sharing my progress with you.</p>\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>I'm a Grandpa</h4>\n<p>The second happy item of news is a new little Tammik, my first grandchild, Nora Sophie, daughter of my eldest daughter Lina, 29:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Nora Sophie\" src=\"file:////j/photo/jeremy/kids/nora/20140301_113834_cropped.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>\n</center>\n</p>"
