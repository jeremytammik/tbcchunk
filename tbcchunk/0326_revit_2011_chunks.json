With vastly enhanced control over command loading, availability in different contexts, ribbon resources and localisation.\n<li>Localisation support \n<li>External Command Accessibility.\n<li>External Command and External Application registration utility vastly simplifying the implementation of an add-in installer.\n<li>Attributes for configuring ExternalCommand and ExternalApplication behaviour: Transaction mode and Regeneration option.\n<li>New element iteration interfaces: completely revamped element iteration and filtering access.\n<li>Revit exceptions.\n<li>Replacement for AnalyticalModel.\n<li>Replacement for gbXMLParamElem: new EnergyDataSettings class.\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>Some of the major enhancements are:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Model Update: finally, a possibility to react to changes, including modifications of single elements, and dynamically update the model. Whopee!\n<li>Elements changed event: another possibility to react to changes after every transaction gets committed, undone, or redone.\n<li>Failure API: ability for an add-in to define and post failures and react to them.\n<li>Select elements, points on elements, faces and edges: a host of powerful new element and sub-element picking features!\n<li>Pick point on the view active work plane: we finally have the long-awaited pick point functionality!\n<li>Additional options for ribbon customization.\n<li>Create and display Revit-style task dialogues.\n<li>Idling event: an event is raised when it is safe for an add-in to access the active document between user interactions, and allows changes to a document if a new transaction is opened.\n<li>Sun and shadows settings element.\n<li>Revamped MEP demand factor and load classifications.\n<li>Panel schedules: a new comprehensive API to support access to panel schedules and their contents.\n<li>Cable tray and conduit: new classes and elements introduced.\n<li>Analysis Visualization Framework: a mechanism for an analysis application to easily display computation results as transient 3D data in the Revit model.\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Analysis visualisation\" src=\"img/analysis_visualisation.png\"/>\n</center>\n<p>A host of other new features are coming as well, but these are more than enough to get anyone familiar with the API very excited indeed.\n\n<p>I will be covering these enhancements as fast as I can, of course.\nEverything is documented in the beta version of the Revit SDK, so you don't have to wait for me!\n\n<p>ADN members have access to the beta version on the ADN web site.\nNon ADN members will have to wait until the final release is available, I'm afraid.\n\n<p>There is a huge amount of material to cover, and I am really looking forward to diving into all this now.\n\n<p>As mentioned above, some of these changes affect every single existing application, so migration will be an issue for people who have already developed something.\n\n<p>Since some of the changes are so ubiquitous that every single application is affected, one of the things I am thinking of posting is a quick overview of 'My First Revit 2011 Add-In', which will touch on most of the new features that you immediately encounter when working with the new API.\n\n<p>So stay tuned, and let's celebrate!\n\n<h4>Revit 2011 Release Date</h4>\n<p>I just discovered that the \n\n<a href=\"http://bimboom.blogspot.com/2010/03/finally2011-release-dates-for-revit-and.html\">\nRevit 2011 release date</a> has gone public on \n\n<a href=\"http://www.revit3d.com\">\nRevit3d.com</a>, \n\nand thought that might be intersting to share here as well: April 8.\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
