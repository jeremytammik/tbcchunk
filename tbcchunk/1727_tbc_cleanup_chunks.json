On December 5, 2017 the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing AlphaZero, which, within 24 hours, achieved a superhuman level of play in these three games by defeating world-champion programs, Stockfish, elmo, and the 3-day version of AlphaGo Zero, in each case making use of custom tensor processing units (TPUs) that the Google programs were optimized to use.\nAlphaZero was trained solely via \"self-play\" using 5,000 first-generation TPUs to generate the games and 64 second-generation TPUs to train the neural networks, all in parallel, with no access to opening books or endgame tables.\nAfter ... 9 hours of training, the algorithm decisively defeated Stockfish 8 in a time-controlled 100-game tournament (28 wins, 0 losses, and 72 draws)...\n\n[Chess.com](https://www.chess.com) describes the chess implications in the article [Google's AlphaZero Destroys Stockfish In 100-Game Match](https://www.chess.com/news/view/google-s-alphazero-destroys-stockfish-in-100-game-match):\n\n> Chess changed forever today.

We suggest you use `GetElementFilter` instead.\n- In CmdGetMaterials.cs, repeated six times: `AssetProperties.this[]` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2019 and will be removed in the next version of Revit. We suggest you use the `FindByName(String)` or `Get(int)` method instead.\n\nBoth of these deprecated API usages can be easily fixed by following the instructions given by the warning messages."
