Although change is challenging, and at times uncomfortable, we are truly excited to be on this journey with you.\n\nYou can get an impression of some of the directions we are headed by taking a look at\n\n<center>\n[<span style=\"font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold\">xsummit.autodesk.com</span>](http://xsummit.autodesk.com)\n<br/><span style=\"font-size: 80%\">This experience works best when viewed in Chrome</span>\n</center>\n\n\nLast October, we held our first annual Autodesk X Summit.\n\nThis event marked an exciting moment in Autodesk history &ndash; the beginning of the era of experiences over technologies.   As we transform from a company that sells software products to companies into a platform company that offers services and solutions, we have to place human-centred experience design at the heart of our work and company culture to be successful.  This new way of working cannot involve only those in the traditional design or experience roles  &ndash; delivering excellent experiences for our customers is a shared responsibility for every one of us.\n\nIn this spirit, the Autodesk X Summit was broadly inclusive, and gathered designers, engineers, architects, product leaders, customer advocates, salespeople, and makers from all across the company and the globe.  This event marked the beginning of our connected culture, our experience-led era, that binds us all together.\n\nWe curated some of the best content and highlights of the event into a virtual experience which will give you a sense of what happened at the X Summit, and hopefully inspire you to find ways to start to design, connect & lead in your own work.\n\nI invite you to explore the experience, watch the videos, and join this transformation.\nI am excited to work together with you in 2016 and moving forward."

[below](#5).\n\nRegistration is easy.

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"7\"></a>Loading the IES Photometric Web Data for a Light Source\n\n**Question:** How can I programmatically load an IES file defining the photometric web of a light source?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/photometric_web.gif\" alt=\"Photometric web\" width=\"224\">\n</center>\n\nIn the user interface, I have to first select the IES file in the file system:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/photometric_web_ies_file_select.jpg\" alt=\"IES file selection\" width=\"393\">\n</center>\n\nThen, I can specify the photometric web file name as a property on the light source:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/photometric_web_file.jpg\" alt=\"Photometric web file\" width=\"628\">\n</center>\n\nNow I wish to achieve the same result programmatically.\n\n\n**Answer:** The built-in parameter FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE just stores the IES file name.\n\nThe IES file data defined in the file is stored separately in the parameter FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE_CACHE.\n\nSo, here is a possible way to load the IES file by API:\n\n- Open the IES file and read its data into a string.\n- Set the string of IES file data into parameter FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE_CACHE.\n- Set the IES file name to parameter FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n**Addendum by Joel Spahn:** Setting the `FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE` parameter to the full file path (not just the file name) will update both the `FILE` and `CACHE` parameters:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; Symbol.Parameter(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">BuiltInParameter</span>.FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE )\n&nbsp; &nbsp; .Set( filepath );\n</pre>\n\nNote that reading and writing the `FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE_CACHE` directly is a bit tricky since it is encoded and not simply a string representing the IES file contents.\n\n\n**Addendum 2 by Joshua Lumley**\nin [his comment below](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/loading-an-ies-photometric-web-and-exciting-times.html#comment-5063406227):\n\nHere is the tricky part; the encoding directive is `using System.Text`:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span>(&nbsp;myFamilySymbol.LookupParameter(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;Photometric&nbsp;Web&nbsp;File&quot;</span>&nbsp;)&nbsp;!=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">null</span>&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">string</span>&nbsp;myString_Filename&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;myFamilySymbol.get_Parameter(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInParameter</span>.FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.AsString();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">string</span>&nbsp;myString_IESCache&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;myFamilySymbol.get_Parameter(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInParameter</span>.FBX_LIGHT_PHOTOMETRIC_FILE_CACHE&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.AsString();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">byte</span>[]&nbsp;data&nbsp;=&nbsp;System.Text.<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">UnicodeEncoding</span>.Unicode\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.GetBytes(&nbsp;myString_IESCache&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">File</span>.WriteAllBytes(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myString_YourDirectory&nbsp;+&nbsp;myString_Filename,&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data&nbsp;);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n</pre>"
