YouTube for buildings. Tried Unity, but not viable; Forge worked. Present models in public, harvest data.\n- Sandip Jadhav, [simulationHub](https://www.simulationhub.com/), cloud-based CFD, democratizing computational fluid dynamics.\n- Igor Tsinman, [AMCBridge](https://amcbridge.com/) and [openBOM](http://www.openbom.com/).\n\nKean Walmsley presented an overview of and an experiment using Forge for HoloLens VR and AR.\n\nCyrille Fauvel demonstrated another strategy and running sample for easily passing in and interacting with Forge model data in HoloLens.\n\nJim came back and explained the [Forge pricing plans](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/pricing), based on cloud credits or 'cc', currently roughly equivalent to a USD:\n\n- Viewing is free, regardless of numbers\n- Model derivative: cc 0.2 for a simple job, 1.5 for a complex one\n- Design automation: cc 4 per processing hour\n\nHe illustrated with various examples, e.g.:\n\n- 500 DWG files per month: $400\n- Create IFC file from 10 RVT projects per day, 300 jobs per month: 300 * 1.5 = ca. $450 per month\n- Extract BOM from 1000 solidworks models per day (5000 jobs per week, 20k jobs per month): ca. 20000 * 0.2 = $4000 per month\n\nThese plans were drawn up based on interviews with existing partners.\n\nTrial includes 500 cc for the first year.\n\nNote that almost every single Forge demonstration presented on stage today included Revit models integrated with CAD data and database properties from other, completely different sources.\n\nWhatever use you are currently making of Revit, you can expect your models to end up being combined with other data and viewed through the Forge platform very soon indeed.\n\nThink about what you do!\n\nAs a developer, think ahead.\n\nForget the noun = app.\n\nThink of a verb = web service!"
