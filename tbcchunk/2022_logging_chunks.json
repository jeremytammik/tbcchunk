We introduce BIM-GPT, a prompt-based virtual assistant (VA) framework integrating BIM and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technologies to support NL-based IR. A prompt manager and dynamic template generate prompts for GPT models, enabling interpretation of NL queries, summarization of retrieved information, and answering BIM-related questions. In tests on a BIM IR dataset, our approach achieved 83.5% and 99.5% accuracy rates for classifying NL queries with no data and 2% data incorporated in prompts, respectively. Additionally, we validated the functionality of BIM-GPT through a VA prototype for a hospital building. This research contributes to the development of effective and versatile VAs for BIM IR in the construction industry, significantly enhancing BIM accessibility and reducing engineering efforts and training data requirements for processing NL queries.\n  bim_gpt_prompt_manager_nl_processing.png\n\ntwitter:\n\nAccountability, logging, journals, a WPF progress bar with abort button, AI, AEC, #BIM, CO2 and sustainability topics with @AutodeskRevit #RevitAPI @AutodeskAPS @DynamoBIM https://autode.sk/logging\n\nA nice new collection of Revit API, AI and AEC related topics\n&ndash; Accountability, Logging and Journals\n&ndash; WPF progress bar with abort button\n&ndash; Sublime text\n&ndash; Interesting AI motivation: ensure it goes well\n&ndash; Now you see it, now you don't\n&ndash; BIM-GPT AI BIM information retrieval\n&ndash; AEC greenwashing\n&ndash; IKEA life at home report\n&ndash; Climpact carbon footprint action comparison...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nAccountability, logging, journals, a WPF progress bar with abort button, AI, AEC, #BIM, CO2 and sustainability topics with #RevitAPI\n\nhttps://autode.sk/logging\n\n- Accountability, Logging and Journals\n- WPF progress bar with abort button\n- Sublime text\n- Interesting AI motivation: ensure it goes well\n- Now you see it, now you don't\n- BIM-GPT AI BIM information retrieval\n- AEC greenwashing\n- IKEA life at home report\n- Climpact carbon footprint action comparison...\n\n#BIM #DynamoBIM #AutodeskAPS #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n-->"

The format and volume of the data have proven to be challenging.\n\nHow can we interpret Journal Files effectively?\n\n**Answer:** As you may know, Autodesk provides no official support for any use whatsoever of journal files, so you are basically on you own there.\nIn spite of that, The Building Coder has occasionally performed some research in this area and also shared numerous results from other developers in the [category *Journal*](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/journal/).\n\nPossibly, the most complete documentation for interpreting journals is provided by\nthe [Journalysis project](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki), cf.\nThe Building Coder not on [Journal File Analysis](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/05/analysis-of-macros-journals-and-add-in-manager.html#4).\n\nI would like to point out the possible use\nof [`SLOG` files for monitoring purposes](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2021/12/logging-and-monitoring-deleted-data.html),\nso it might be interesting to take a look at those also.\n\nA related question was raised\nby Samuel Arsenault-Brassard of [VIM AEC](https://www.vimaec.com/) in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\non [API Access to user history? \"Show History\"](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/api-access-to-user-history-quot-show-history-quot/m-p/12472116):\n\n**Question:** The data in the \"Show History\" button is extremely useful to analyse the work done on a file or detect plagiarism:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/user_history.jpg\" alt=\"User history\" title=\"User history\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 627 Pixel Width: 861 -->\n</center>\n\nIs it possible to obtain this data through the API?\nIf not, is it possible to obtain it though BIM 360/ACC?\nWe want to obtain the name of the users and when they saved or interacted with the project.\n\n**Answer:** I suspect no Revit API access.\nI also suspect that if no Revit API access, then even less so in more removed environments such as BIM 360 or ACC.\nHowever, you can certainly obtain the required information in various ways without any explicit API access to this specific functionality.\n\nA pretty direct approach might be to\nuse [`PostCommand`](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.3) to\nlaunch the built-in `Show History` command and then use the Windows API to harvest the data displayed in the UI form that you show in the screen snapshot.\n\nYou can certainly also scrape the required into from the journal or SLOG files, if you prefer, cf. above.\n\nThe development team adds:\n\nA: This \"history\" is the list of synchronizations if I am not mistaken.\nWhile journals can catch this, you can also pull it from the SLOG associated to the model and that catches all users instead of one by one (which is what the journal would return).\nThere is a limit to the length of that history though (not sure how it compares with the history of the .rvt itself).\n\nB: Yes, it is the list of Syncs. I don’t think there is any Revit API to query this list.\nThere is/are APS DM APIs that query ACC/BIM 360 model history, but it is the history of the publishes that push the versions from RCM to ACC/BIM 360, so it doesn’t include info for all syncs.\n\nC: Thinking outside of the box here… I removed the slog and all the associated files and the history was still extracted… Is there any chance that list of syncs is taken from the \\global\\history portion of the structured storage? Can that data be extracted easily?\n\nIf so a stand-alone app that exposes the username/time/synch number for a list of .rvt files could likely be quite valuable for a good amount of companies and educational institutions…\n\nB: Right, the source for the data on Show History dialog is a stream in the RVT model, rather than the slog file. I agree it should be valuable to expose the data of sync history outside Revit, but afaik it is not feasible, as the data is binary, require Revit for the deserialization.\n\nD: When writing Revit data into AEC data model during sync is available in the future, I think the history of cloud models can be filtered and queried in the AECDM.\n\nAs for file-based and server-based worksharing, we don't have backlog item on such request. SLOG file would be an incomplete workaround.  In my opinion, we may not invest the efforts on file-based and server-based worksharing workflow only. Cloud worksharing might be higher priority than the other two.\n\nBy the way, the development team would be interested to learn about what you would like to achieve and what kind of insights you hope to get from this.\nWhat is the business value in this for you?\n\n**Response:** Teachers use it to see if students copied each other's work.\nI've detected firms that farmed their work to other firms without telling their clients.\nI've found users who worked at 3AM, showing a lack of time management (their Revit work was also pathetic).\n\nOften, engineering firms don't work on models for months.\nThe engineers don't know Revit, refuse to learn it and don't hire enough \"Revit technicians\" to do the work as specified in the contract.\nMeanwhile, the architects are stuck doing the 3D work of the engineers.\nOr, a firm will say they have 10 employees working on the project, but it's really 1-2 underpaid employees doing all the work.\n\nI've also seen projects to major clients where all the users are interns that work for 2-3 months on the project and disappear.\nThen the client is surprised by the low quality of the Revit work and wonders why it's not following the BIM Execution plan.\n\nSometimes a malicious or disgruntled user will go in and mess up a file on purpose or they are just bad and deny their actions.\n\nSo, it's for accountability.\nTo inspect all the warts and mould of the industry that pumps out students who don't know Revit into the workforce year after year.\n\n**Answer:** Thank you very much for your clarification and very sorry to hear of this dismal state of affairs. Where is the world getting to, one asks? Can we be saved? Will AI make it better? Or much, much worse? Interesting times...\n\n**Response:** When owners/clients understand the value/potential of their BIM, give clear BIM instructions (instead of minimal bid contract with no clear BIM requirements) and are able to easily check for compliance, the industry will be \"fixed\".\n\nUntil then, owners don't know that they are receiving subpar BIM, have no vision about the (lost) potential of their BIM models and are unable to judge if what they paid for is good. Designers are not encouraged to deliver anything of value to get profit from the minimal bid contracts and so the cycle of no accountability, no effort & no skills continues.\n\n**Answer:** So, there is hope, and your tool can help &nbsp; :-)\n\n**Response:** Oh yes!\nOur tool will be a scalable accountability monster for those who know what they want and for deep BIM auditing in general.\n\n<center>\n<!-- <img src=\"img/bim_dashboard.png\" alt=\"BIM dashboard\" title=\"BIM dashboard\" width=\"400\"/> Pixel Height: 999 Pixel Width: 999 -->\n\n<img src=\"img/bim_dashboard2.png\" alt=\"BIM dashboard\" title=\"BIM dashboard\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 1,024 Pixel Width: 1,024 -->\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** Wow, great picture! DALL-E? Brilliant.\nNone of my attempts have turned out that well.\nI guess I need to learn better prompting.\n\n**Response:** DALL-E prompt: \"Can you make me an image of a BIM manager who is having the time of his life with a dashboard of data showing accountability. He's in a kind of puppet master moment, happy with all the power of the data, able to see where there are deficiencies, gains and issues throughout all his BIM models of complex architectural projects.\"\n\nRicaun shared another useful pointer on journals in his answer\nto [the syntax and structure of the Journal file in Revit](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/the-syntax-and-structure-of-the-journal-file-in-revit/m-p/12490089):\n\n> Journal is used by Autodesk internally to replicate the same steps to make sure the Revit does not break in development.\nIf you want to know more, there is a great AU class from AU 2023 by Brian Mackey and Zach Kron about Revit Journal:\n\n> - [Revit Journal Files: They Aren’t Just for Autodesk Support](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Journal-Files-They-Arent-Just-Autodesk-Support-2018#video)\n\nFinally, to round this off, looking at journal file entries is also mentioned as an alternative to `AdWindows`\nfor [intercepting commands executed by keyboard shortcuts](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/intercepting-commands-executed-by-keyboard-shortcuts/td-p/12457597)."
