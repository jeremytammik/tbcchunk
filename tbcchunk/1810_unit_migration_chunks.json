    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>Solution\n\nThe solution is straight-forward: all unit settings seen by a user in a document in `ProjectUnits` are stored in a container class `DisplayUnit`.\n\nThese settings can be read from one document through its `DisplayUnitSystem` and set to another with the `SetUnits` method.\n\nThe add-in take the source data from a source document, stores it, and sets it to all target documents. \n \nOne could obviously alter this to read data from a text file or something more fancy &ndash; but why bother when you can use a Revit template?\n\nWant to convert to metric?\nSelect the metric template of your choice and paste it where you want.\n\nWant to convert to imperial? Same thing.\n\nImperial decimal to imperial fractional? Just like before.\n\nThe add-in requires a source file (like a template) from which to read the units; then, it will write those units to all Revit files inside a selected folder.\n\nGrab the add-in source code from\nthe [UnitMigration GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/UnitMigration).\n\nMany thanks to Dragos Turmac, Principal Engineer, Autodesk and Bogdan Teodorescu, Team Manager, Autodesk for implementing and sharing this!"
