However, I am afraid that this could quickly get quite complicated and consequently slow.</p><p>Is there a quicker way to find adjacent rooms and spaces within a certain range? Could bounding box intersection filters help, for instance?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Congratulations on starting work on such an interesting problem.</p><p>You should definitely do some additional exploration from an end user point of view, asking product usage experts and application engineers.</p><p>As far as I know, some of this kind of data is available from the Revit BIM with no programming required, e.g. via the gbXML file.</p><p>Please also take a deep look at the tools and results provided by the\n\n<a href=\"http://autodesk.typepad.com/bpa\">\nBPA team</a> for\n\nbuilding performance analysis.</p><p>As far as I know, <a href=\"http://dynamobim.org\">Dynamo</a> also provides a good entry point for that.</p><p>I would be surprised – and impressed – if you are aiming to implement anything – in the beginning stages or your exploration, in any case – that has not already been addressed by the BPA and Dynamo communities.</p><p>Finally, from the pure Revit API point of view, The Building Coder provides a topic list 5.2 on\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.2\">\n2D Booleans and Adjacent Areas</a> that I just updated for you and lists some previous discussions and explorations in this area.</p><a name=\"4\"></a>"

I am not in favour of religions maintaining a power structure with the purpose of controlling people and distorting their thinking.</p><p>Aren't all religions like that?   — No. In America, C.G. Jung met some Pueblo Indians who prayed every morning towards a neighbouring mountain. The chief told him, \"Our prayers help God heave the sun over the mountain.\" Jung aptly commented that these people felt equal to their God. That is something completely different from becoming a slave of one's religion. You have to find God in yourself, as already stated by many mystics in the past.</p><p>And how is it for you personally?   — I agree with Einstein that the universe is not without meaning. That is quite a religious feeling.</p><p>And what is that meaning?   — The world is not random. It is constructed to encourage development of the good.</p>"
