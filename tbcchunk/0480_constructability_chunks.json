The latter was purposely chosen to force simplification of geometry in order to address the buildability question, with all elements being reduced to planar forms (arcs and lines)</p>\n<p>The images below outline the process. Although the 3D spline cannot be visualised in the generic model family, it can still be used as an underlying generator for geometry. It was evaluated at regular intervals along its length to provide setout points for the arc sub-components. The division number was progressively increased until the component junctions visually appeared to be smooth (tangents almost co-linear). Curve derivatives were extracted at these points and the tangent vectors used to create plane-normals for the cross-bracing and rafters:-</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Roller-Coaster Setout\" src=\"img/ritchie-RollerCoaster-Setout.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n<p>The bracing points were tapered via linear interpolation and the rafter spans adjusted using a sine function:-</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Roller-Coaster Model\" src=\"img/ritchie-RollerCoaster-Model.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Finally, a reception desk was added using a similar process (spline as generator) to give a sense of scale to the project:-</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Roller-Coaster Render\" src=\"img/ritchie-RollerCoaster-Render.jpg\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Many thanks to Ritchie for these inspiring ideas and images!\n</p></p>"
