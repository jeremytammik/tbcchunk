In addition to web service APIs, Autodesk Platform Services (APS) offers an app marketplace of pre-built solutions that can help you quickly connect gaps, as well as a cloud information model that can streamline how teams create and share project data across project lifecycles.  \n\n- linked element visibility\n  I know, the question of \"How to hide an individual element from a linked model via the Revit API\" has been asked multiple times and there seems to be no way to do this yet.\n  However, what I would like to know is, if there is any way to find out if a specific element in a linked model was hidden by the user. Basically, get an element by hovering over the model and using the TAB key to find an element. Then right click &gt; Hide in View &gt; Element.\n  As far as I have tried this, .IsHidden() method only works for the whole linked model, not for individual elements inside it.\n  Does anyone have an idea if and how this could be done?\n  Dimitar Venkov\n  If there is a parameter/value combo that is unique to the elements in the link that you're trying to hide, a view filter will do the job.\n  Scott Conover\n  I believe reading the hide status for an element in a link instance would also be a part of the missing API (\n  @Diane Christoforo\n  ’s team had looked into how to expose this).   I think the only way to look at elements visibility in the link would through the CustomExporter - which will return you the elements visible in the link but not the ones that are not.    Might be a bit expensive just to get this information.\n\n- visibility of a specific element in a view\n  https://autodesk.slack.com/archives/C0SR6NAP8/p1664278836397949\n  [Q] I am on the Assemble team and trying to determine if a Structural Framing element is visible when processing a model.  The element type is a Girder and the View has the Girder subcategory turned off in the Visibility settings.  I have not figured out the magic to check these 2 things:\n  What is the type of Structural Framing element, that is Girder, Joist, etc.\n  How to determine the Visibility setting for these subcategory elements\n  If you could just map out the pseudo code for the necessary calls, I would appreciate it!\n  [A] FamilyInstance.StructuralUsage should tell you #1.   For #2, if the category is turned off View.GetCategoryHidden() will identify this.  You need the category id for the type you are looking for, which I'd expect to get from new ElementId( BuiltInCategory.OST_Girder).  There may not be an easy to code relationship between the StructuralInstanceUsage and the built in (sub)categories in this case.\n  [Q] Thanks Scott.  It's a pain to sort all these subcategory visibilities out, I can't believe there is not a built in function for an element's visibility in the active view.\n\n- set wall join to miter for full face\n  CalculateSpatialElementGeometry(), not retrieving all the boundary faces\n  https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/calculatespatialelementgeometry-not-retrieving-all-the-boundary/m-p/11446249\n\n twitter:\n\nAU news, the Autodesk Platform Services and Forma for AEC, visibility of linke element and wall miter to retrieve full faces in the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon https://autode.sk/miterwallface\n\nAutodesk University 2022 is in full swing and brings exciting news.\nMeanwhile, the Revit API discussion forum continues unperturbed with other equally exciting conversations and solutions\n&ndash; Forge is dead &ndash; long live APS\n&ndash; Forma for AEC\n&ndash; Linked element visibility\n&ndash; Visibility of a specific element in a view\n&ndash; Miter join walls to retrieve full faces...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nAU news, the Autodesk Platform Services and Forma for AEC, visibility of linke element and wall miter to retrieve full faces in the #RevitAPI\n\nhttps://autode.sk/miterwallface\n\n- Forge is dead; long live APS\n- Forma for AEC\n- Linked element visibility\n- Visibility of a specific element in a view\n- Miter join walls to retrieve full faces...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n-->"
