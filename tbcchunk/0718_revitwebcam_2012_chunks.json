Idling Event Repetition</h4>\n<p>By simply migrating the existing Revit 2012 Idling event code to Revit 2013, we are implicitly acception the new default Event repetition behaviour:\n\n<p>In the default mode, a single raise of the event is made each time Revit begins an idle session. \nWhen the user is active in the Revit user interface, idle sessions begin whenever the mouse stops moving for a moment or when a command completes. \nHowever, if the user is not active in the user interface at all, Revit may not invoke additional idling sessions for quite some time; this means that an add-in subscribing to the Idling event may not be able to take advantage of time when the user leaves the machine completely idle for a period of time.\n\n<p>The old behaviour, which was the only available optin in Revit 2012, is now the non-default mode:\n\n<p>To request the non-default mode, an add-in must force Revit to keep the idling session open and to make repeated calls to its event handler. \nIn this mode, Revit will continue to make Idling calls even if the user is totally inactive. \nHowever, this can result in performance degradation for the system on which Revit is running, because the CPU remains fully engaged in serving Idling events during the Revit application's idle time.\n\n<p>In the case of RevitWebcam, if you wish to see the webcam image continue bein updated repeatedly on the selected BIM element face even if no user interaction is taking place, the non-default behaviour must be requested.\n\n<p>This is done by calling the new SetRaiseWithoutDelay method on the IdlingEventArgs instance passed into the Idling event handler.\n\n<p>The call must be made each time the Idling event handler is called. \nRevit reverts to the default Idling repetition mode if this method is not called every time in your callback.\n\n<p>In RevitWebcam, I defined a new static global Boolean variable '_raise_without_delay' with which I can control this behaviour at runtim from the debugger.\nIn the beginning of the OnIdling, I added the following lines:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( _raise_without_delay )\n  {\n    e.SetRaiseWithoutDelay();\n  }\n</pre>\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>4. External Event</h4>\n<p>By far the largest change in this series, and actually the whole point of this exercise, as well as the original moticvation to \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/revit-webcam-2012.html\">\nport to 2012</a> at all.\n\n<p>I implemented a new WebcamEvent external event class, removed the Idling event handler, and moved most of its code into the new class instead.\n\n<p>I ended up significantly cleaning up and simplifying my GreyscaleBitmapData class to avoid storing the bitmap and instead just calculate and retain the data that I need to display the AVF results.\nThis also helps avoid an error saying that the bitmap is already in use.\nThat also provided an opportunity to very simply flip the image upside-down so that it appears the right way up in Revit again.\n\n\n<pre>\n</pre>\n<a href=\"\">\n</a>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"

    "chunk_text": "<h4>3. Idling Event Repetition</h4><p>By simply migrating the existing Revit 2012 Idling event code to Revit 2013, we are implicitly acception the new default Event repetition behaviour:\n\n<p>In the default mode, a single raise of the event is made each time Revit begins an idle session. \nWhen the user is active in the Revit user interface, idle sessions begin whenever the mouse stops moving for a moment or when a command completes. \nHowever, if the user is not active in the user interface at all, Revit may not invoke additional idling sessions for quite some time; this means that an add-in subscribing to the Idling event may not be able to take advantage of time when the user leaves the machine completely idle for a period of time.\n\n<p>The old behaviour, which was the only available optin in Revit 2012, is now the non-default mode:\n\n<p>To request the non-default mode, an add-in must force Revit to keep the idling session open and to make repeated calls to its event handler. \nIn this mode, Revit will continue to make Idling calls even if the user is totally inactive. \nHowever, this can result in performance degradation for the system on which Revit is running, because the CPU remains fully engaged in serving Idling events during the Revit application's idle time.\n\n<p>In the case of RevitWebcam, if you wish to see the webcam image continue bein updated repeatedly on the selected BIM element face even if no user interaction is taking place, the non-default behaviour must be requested.\n\n<p>This is done by calling the new SetRaiseWithoutDelay method on the IdlingEventArgs instance passed into the Idling event handler.\n\n<p>The call must be made each time the Idling event handler is called. \nRevit reverts to the default Idling repetition mode if this method is not called every time in your callback.\n\n<p>In RevitWebcam, I defined a new static global Boolean variable '_raise_without_delay' with which I can control this behaviour at runtim from the debugger.\nIn the beginning of the OnIdling, I added the following lines:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( _raise_without_delay )\n  {\n    e.SetRaiseWithoutDelay();\n  }\n</pre>\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>4. External Event</h4>\n<p>By far the largest change in this series, and actually the whole point of this exercise, as well as the original moticvation to \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/revit-webcam-2012.html\">\nport to 2012</a> at all.\n\n<p>I implemented a new WebcamEvent external event class, removed the Idling event handler, and moved most of its code into the new class instead.\n\n<p>I ended up significantly cleaning up and simplifying my GreyscaleBitmapData class to avoid storing the bitmap and instead just calculate and retain the data that I need to display the AVF results.\nThis also helps avoid an error saying that the bitmap is already in use.\nThat also provided an opportunity to very simply flip the image upside-down so that it appears the right way up in Revit again.\n\n\n<pre>\n</pre>\n<a href=\"\">\n</a>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
