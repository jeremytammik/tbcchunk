Thank you!\n\nThe best database for storing a Revit BIM model is the Revit database in the RVT file format.\n\nUnfortunately, you have no direct access to the underlying data, so that won't help resolve your question.\n\nYou are basically answering your own question quite well, I think.\n\nIt depends on what you want to do. It also depends very much on your past experience, your personal preferences and your future plans.\n\nI am not a professional programmer or a database expert, so you should take any advice I give with many grains of salt.\n\nI would advise: avoid traditional SQL!\n\nUnless you are an expert on that or have other pressing reasons to choose it.\n\nInstead:\n\nGo for the much more modern, scalable, minimalistic, low-cost, simple to use, web-adapted NoSQL options instead.\n\nThis personal opinion of mine in based on my experience developing\nseveral samples to [connect the desktop and cloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud)\nusing Revit and its API on the desktop and JavaScript, Node.js web servers, CouchDB and MongoDB databases in the cloud.\n\n**Response:** The only issue I'm having is that we would also like to link some of our internal databases to the Revit database.\n\nThe internal databases are MySQL, so is it possible to link a NoSQL database to a MySQL database?\n\n**Answer:** To me, that sounds like a good reason to choose MySQL after all.\n\nPoor you, you will not be learning anything new...\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/friends_use_nosql.jpg\" alt=\"Friends use NoSQL\" title=\"Friends use NoSQL\" width=\"500\"/> <!-- 1400 -->\n</center>"
