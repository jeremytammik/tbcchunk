It has transformed how we workshare, for the better'*.\n\nAutodesk is working on bringing these two technologies together to form a common data environment that spans the entire project from concept to commissioning to building operations and beyond.\n\nThe common data environment can be programmatically accessed and driven through the Forge web services.\n\n\n####<a name=\"3\"></a>Forge Web Services\n\nHere are the main groups Forge web service endpoints as of today &ndash; please always refer\nto [developer.autodesk.com](http://autode.sk/2gRmOmI) for the most up-to-date list:\n\n- General Availability\n    - Authentication (OAuth)\n    - Data Management API\n    - Design Automation API\n    - Model Derivative API\n    - Viewer\n- Beta\n    - 3D Print API (deprecated)\n    - BIM 360 API\n    - Reality Capture API\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>BIM 360 Docs\n\n[BIM 360 Docs](http://info.bim360.autodesk.com/construction-document-software) provides real-time access to the most recent versions of digital plans and documents, so contractors, foremen, document managers, architects, and other key personnel can spend less time struggling with files and more time building. From concept to completion, BIM 360 software helps the entire team stay on-schedule.\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>The Forge Issues Service API\n\nMikako Harada and Galia Traub presented a session\non [extending BIM 360 Docs with the Issues Service API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOQEyI-EMAQ)\nat [Forge DevCon 2016](https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2016):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOQEyI-EMAQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nThis session introduces the Issues Service, one of the first BIM 360 APIs to be made available in Forge.\nIt allows users to create issues related to documents that are stored either in BIM 360 Docs, or more broadly within the Forge ecosystem. It walks you step-by-step through using the Issues API and showing what is possible through a series of demonstrations of practical examples.\n\nThe article\non the [enhanced commenting experience with in-canvas comments](https://blog.a360.autodesk.com/a360-release-enhanced-commenting-and-markup-tools) shows \nwhat use the A360 development team have made of the issues API.\n\nOne really good aspect of the collection of Forge web services is that the Autodesk development teams and external developers have the exact same glueing and connecting tools at hand.\nIn other words, so do you!\n\nMikako also presented\nan [introduction to BIM360](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/10/introduction-to-bim-360.html) as part of\nthe [Forge Hackathon webinar series, cf. below](#7):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVwaXTitSRw?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nIf you are interested in more API related BIM 360 information, please refer to Mikako's blog, [The Field of View &ndash; BIM 360 API &amp; cloud-based technologies for the AEC industry](https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com).\n\n\n####<a name=\"6\"></a>24 Forge DevCon Presentation Recordings\n\nMikako's presentation is just one of a collection \nof [24 DevCon presentation recordings](http://www.slideshare.net/Autodesk/clipboards/autodesk-forge-devcon-2016) is\navailable on SlideShare.\n\nFor your convenience, here is a table of contents:\n\n- Introduction to WebVR &ndash; Tony Parisi\n- Building a Drone Imagery Service &ndash; Jia Huang, Software Engineer @ 3DRobotics\n- From Desktop to the Cloud with Forge &ndash; Fernando Malard, CTO, ofcdesk, llc\n- 10 Great Fusion 360 Apps &ndash; Brian Ekins and Patrick Rainsberry\n- Forecast for Design, Make, and Use is Cloudy &ndash; Justin Berger, Open Innovation Strategist\n- Introduction to Forge 3D Print API with Sample Applications &ndash; Tomer Galon, Product Manager, and Ania Lipka, Principal Developer\n- You Had Me at HoloWorld &ndash; Introduction to Building for HoloLens &ndash; Dona Sarkar, Principal Product Person\n- Creating your next VR Walkthrough with Cloud Rendered Stereo Panoramas &ndash; Michael Beale, Autodesk Developer\n- Collaborative VR using Google Cardboard and the Forge Viewer &ndash; Kean Walmsley, Platform Architect &amp; Evangelist, Autodesk Research\n- Building Data Centric Applications on Forge &ndash; Oleg Shilovitsky, openBoM CEO and co-founder, and Boris Shoov, AMC Bridge, Executive VP\n- Drawings!
