A circuit is a closed space bounded by walls where a room can be created. The simple example below reports information about the rooms that already exist and creates new rooms in circuits that don't have rooms. We are aware of some ideas about how circuits and the PlanCircuit class could be improved, which are part of a wish list item that might give you some further ideas about the potential future use of circuits and the plan topology class:</p><ul>\n<li>There is currently no tie from the relatively abstract PlanCircuit class to the geometry that makes the circuit.</li>\n<li>Determine if a room had been placed in a circuit.</li>\n<li>Determine which room is related to the circuit.</li>\n<li>If a room is not associated with a circuit, determine where this particular circuit is; having some tie to the geometry that defines the circuit would make this more useful.</li>\n</ul><p>Here is the example that reports information about the rooms that already exist and creates new rooms in circuits that don't have rooms.</p><pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"teal\">Application</span> app = commandData.Application;\n<span class=\"teal\">Document</span> doc = app.ActiveDocument;\n \n<span class=\"teal\">List</span>&lt;<span class=\"teal\">Element</span>&gt; list = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">List</span>&lt;<span class=\"teal\">Element</span>&gt;();\n \n<span class=\"teal\">Filter</span> f = app.Create.Filter.NewTypeFilter(\n  <span class=\"blue\">typeof</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Level</span> ) );\n \n<span class=\"blue\">int</span> n = doc.get_Elements( f, list );\n<span class=\"teal\">Level</span> level = list[0] <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Level</span>;\n \n<span class=\"teal\">PlanTopology</span> pt = doc.get_PlanTopology( level );\n \n<span class=\"blue\">string</span> output = <span class=\"maroon\">\"Rooms on \"</span>\n  + level.Name + <span class=\"maroon\">\":\"</span>\n  + <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\n  Name and Number : Area\"</span>;\n \n<span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Room</span> r <span class=\"blue\">in</span> pt.Rooms )\n{\n  output += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\n  \"</span> + r.Name + <span class=\"maroon\">\" : \"</span>\n    + <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.RealString( r.Area ) + <span class=\"maroon\">\" sqf\"</span>;\n}\n<span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.InfoMsg( output );\n \noutput = <span class=\"maroon\">\"Circuits without rooms:\"</span>\n  + <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\n  Number of Sides : Area\"</span>;\n \n<span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">PlanCircuit</span> pc <span class=\"blue\">in</span> pt.Circuits )\n{\n  <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( !pc.IsRoomLocated )\n  {\n    output += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\n  \"</span> + pc.SideNum + <span class=\"maroon\">\" : \"</span>\n      + <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.RealString( pc.Area ) + <span class=\"maroon\">\" sqf\"</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"teal\">Room</span> r = doc.Create.NewRoom( <span class=\"blue\">null</span>, pc );\n  }\n}\n<span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.InfoMsg( output );\n</pre><p>The code uses Revit 2009 API filters to determine the first level in the model.\nThe plan topology of that level is retrieved and queried for all its rooms.\nIn the first loop, the name and area of each room of the plan topology is queried and displayed in a message box.\nIn the second loop, each circuit with no room is queried for its number of sides and area, and a new room is created for it.\nThe method NewRoom can be called with an existing unplaced room to place it in the given circuit, or with a null argument to create a new room.</p><p>Here is the output generated by the first run in a simple model with two closed wall loops, only one of which has a room placed in it so far:</p><pre>\nRooms on Level 1:\n  Name and Number : Area\n  Room 1 : 278.14 sqf\nCircuits without rooms:\n  Number of Sides : Area\n  4 : 114.53 sqf\n</pre><p>In all subsequent runs after the first one, rooms have been created in each circuit, and the output changes to this:</p><pre>\nRooms on Level 1:\n  Name and Number : Area\n  Room 1 : 278.14 sqf\n  Room 2 : 114.53 sqf\nCircuits without rooms:\n  Number of Sides : Area\n</pre><p>Here is\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/files/bc10019.zip\">\nversion 1.0.0.19</a>\n\nof the complete Visual Studio solution with the new command CmdPlanTopology discussed here.</p>"
