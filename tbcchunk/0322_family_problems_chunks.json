Pity. \nI searched your blog and haven't found anything obvious for this one. \n\n<p>Any ideas? Even just pointing me to a sample would be great.\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, that property was removed. \nIn Revit 2010, you can just open the family document instead and iterate over its elements in the normal fashion. \nI actually did provide an explanation and explicit replacement code in the post describing\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/porting-the-building-coder-samples.html\">\nporting The Building Coder samples</a> from \n\n2009 to 2010.\n\n\n\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
