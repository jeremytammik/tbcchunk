Is there any way to retrieve the model group information in Forge, or is it 'lost in translation'?\n\n**Answer:** The viewer doesn't support it out of the box, but the information is still preserved in the Forge translation of the RVT model, not lost in translation.\n\nYou can navigate Groups and their Members by descending down the non-graphical property hierarchy, starting at the root/model element. Then, it is also possible to programmatically simulate group selection by selecting group members.\n\nHere is an example of a group (ID=50) with one member (ID=389), which is a chair element in the Revit sample project rac_basic_sample_project.rvt:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/forge_viewer_group_properties.png\" alt=\"Forge viewer group properties\" title=\"Forge viewer group properties\" width=\"670\"/> <!-- 2680 -->\n</center>\n\nThe StackOverflow discussion\non [grouping elements cannot find in Forge viewer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61998004) shows \na pretty neat code snippet by Eason Kang implementing this functionality.\n\nMany thanks to Traian Stanev and Eason for their valuable help in addressing this."

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> Specifying the Revit UI Language in DA4R\n\nThe next Japanese Forge issue is *8492 &ndash; language settings of DA4R engine*:\n\n**Question:** I have a question about DA4R, Design Automation for Revit.\n\nCan I specify the language of the Engine of DR4R?\nI would like to use the Japanese Engine &ndash; is the default engine English?\nMy add-in seems to depend on the Japanese Engine.\n\n**Answer:** Good programming practice would ensure that the add-in is not language dependent.\n\nSince every DA4R add-in is a DB-only application, it should in theory be language independent automatically.\n\nUnfortunately, Revit itself does not completely follow this practice in all points.\n\nFurthermore, every Revit BIM relies on many component that can be modified and added by end users, e.g., family definitions, which are pretty hard to make language independent.\n\nSo, I understand your challenge.\n\nAs a first step, let's look at the situation in the desktop Revit API and search\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) for\nthe term 'language'; that turns up two useful entries:\n\n- [How to change Revit language using API?](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-change-revit-language-using-api/m-p/9156524)\n- [How to get the language of Revit user interface?](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-get-the-language-of-revit-user-interface/m-p/6840139)\n\nThe Revit API provides\nthe [`Application.Language` property](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/2b1d8b80-a11c-2a57-63bd-6c0d67691879.htm) to\ndetermine the language used in the current session of Revit, so that part is easy.\n\nHowever, the API does not provide any method to control the language being used.\n\nOn the desktop, you can use the language switch in the Revit.exe command line, cf. the discussions\non [Revit command-line switches](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/01/distances-switches-kiss-ing-and-a-dino.html#3)\nand [multiple language RESX resource files](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/multiple-language-resx-resource-files.html)\n\nNow, trying to apply this insight to the DA4R environment, there are two questions:\n\n- Can we specify command line argument to the Revit engine in DA4R?\n- Will the DA4R Revit engine react to the language switch in the command line passed in?\n\nI believe the answer to both of these is yes.\n\nSearching for 'commandline' and 'revitcoreconsole' turns up [an example of passing in a command line argument to the DA4R engine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63128763/error-application-revitcoreconsole-exe-exits-with-code-19088744-which-indicate).\n\nAnd yes, indeed, the same language command line switch works with an optional `/l` argument to `revitcoreconsole.exe`.\n\nIt is described in more detail with a sample code snippet in the official documentation\non [publishing an activity](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step5-publish-activity/#additional-notes).\n\n**Response:** I tried the `/l` option, and then my add-in completed the process with no error:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  revitcoreconsole.exe /l JPN (arguments...)\n</pre>\n\nThanks much for your support and information!\n\nThanks also to Rahul Bhobe for helpful advice."
