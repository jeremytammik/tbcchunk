The Accelerator will allow you to spend quality time working on your project making use of Autodesk Cloud APIs while benefitting from help and advice from Autodesk API experts.\nIt’s an ideal opportunity to get away from the daily grind and work on something new.</p><p>To apply for this program, all you have to do is send us a 1000 word proposal outlining your proposed application. Due to popular demand, we extended the application deadline by a week to Saturday January 17th, updated from\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/11/cloud-accelerator-vdc-and-transaction-groups.html#2\">\nthe initial announcement</a>.\n\nThat said, if you submit your proposal by the original deadline of January 10th, we will have time to provide you with feedback to increase the chance of your proposal being accepted.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, then please visit <a href=\"http://www.autodeskcloudaccelerator.com\">autodeskcloudaccelerator.com</a> for more information, or email or call us with your questions. We hope to see you in March.</p><p>For two weeks, March 9 to March 20, 2015, participants will work intensively on their chosen project with the help, support, and training of the Autodesk Cloud engineering teams.  This includes daily classes by industry experts on important aspects of cloud development and one-on-one help from these experts in real time. At the end of the Accelerator, you will also have the opportunity to present your prototype to senior Autodesk executives.</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Autodesk Cloud Accelerator\" src=\"img/cloud_accelerator.jpg\" width=\"250\"/>\n</center><p>Don't miss this opportunity to spend two weeks of quality time in sunny San Francisco working on your own exciting cloud project while benefitting from a wealth of expert help and advice.</p><a name=\"2\"></a>"
