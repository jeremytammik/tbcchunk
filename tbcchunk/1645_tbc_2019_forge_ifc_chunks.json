We suggest you use the 'FindByName(String)' or 'Get(int)' method instead.\n\nI will ignore them for the time being.\n\nThe flat migrated version is [release 2019.0.138.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.0).\n\nThe [diff between the last 2018 version, 2018.0.138.4, and 2019.0.138.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/compare/2018.0.138.4...2019.0.138.0),\nshows the minimal changes I made.\n\nTo add the final finishing touch, I also updated the readme file with new Revit and .NET framework version badges.\n\nThe current version is [2019.0.138.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.1).\n\n\n####<a name=\"3\"></a>The AdnRme MEP HVAC and Electrical Samples for Revit 2019\n\nSimilarly, I updated the [AdnRme MEP HVAC and electrical samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme) for Revit 2019.\n\nThe flat migration is captured in [release 2019.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.0), \nand I added badges here as well in [release 2019.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1).\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>AdnRevitApiLabsXtra for Revit 2019\n\nNext, I migrated the [AdnRevitApiLabsXtra](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra) with similar ease.\n\nNo code changes required &ndash; again, just updated the .NET framework version and the Revit API assembly DLL references.\n\nThe current version is [2019.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1).\n\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>Convert RVT to IFC via Forge\n\nLooking toward the future making use of web-based component technology,\n[Simon Moreau](https://github.com/simonmoreau) of [Bouygues Immobilier](https://www.bouygues-immobilier.com), author of the [BIM42 blog](http://bim42.com),\nshared his nice new [RevitToIFC web app](https://github.com/simonmoreau/RevitToIFC).\n\nRevit To IFC is a web application using\nthe [Autodesk Forge](https://autodesk-forge.github.io) web\nservices to convert Revit file to the IFC format.\nYou can use it to upload a Revit file to Forge and download back the resulting converted file.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonmoreau/RevitToIFC/master/doc/revitToIfc.gif\" alt=\"RevitToIFC\" width=\"500\"/>\n</center>\n\n\n####<a name=\"6\"></a>Forge Accelerators\n\nDoes this inspire you to want to get started with Forge yourself?\n\nAn easy way to do so is to attend a [Forge accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/forge-accelerator).\n\nThe upcoming ones are here:\n\n- Boston, USA &ndash; April 30 - May 4\n- Bengaluru, India &ndash; May 7-10\n- Barcelona, Spain &ndash; June 11-15\n- San Francisco, USA &ndash; June 18-22\n- Sydney, Australia &ndash; July 9-12\n\n####<a name=\"7\"></a>Forge Webinars\n\nTwo upcoming Forge webinars are dedicated to more bleeding edge technology, HFDM &ndash; High Frequency Data Management &ndash; and the new app framework:\n\n- 2018-04-26, 8.00 AM PST, 90 minutes\n&ndash; [The Future of Making Things on Forge: Sneak Peek at Forge NextGen (HFDM & App Framework)](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8209398405782333955)\n- 2018-05-09, 8.00 AM PST, 90 minutes\n&ndash; [A technical introduction to Forge High Frequency Data Management (HFDM) SDK and Forge App Framework](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3624195224359611394)\n\nYou might also want to check out the recording on the topic from the Forge DevCon 2017 class at Autodesk University,\n[FDC125274: Introducing the Future of CAD - Forge HFDM and the Forge App Framework](http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/classes/year-2017/forge/fdc125274).\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/datacentricapps_800x640.gif\" alt=\"Data-centric apps\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n\n####<a name=\"8\"></a>Open Position for an Infrastructure BIM Implementation Consultant in Northern Europe\n\nLet's end for today with something completely different:\n \nWould you be interested in a position as a *BIM Implementation Consultant for AEC Infrastructure* with a flexible location in Northern Europe?\n\n####<a name=\"8.1\"></a>Position Overview\n\nAutodesk Consulting implements Autodesk BIM solutions for our customers across the region.
