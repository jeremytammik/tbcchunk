This tool is a game-changer for both developers and users as it allows you to easily compare differences between two elements. Not only that, but it also uses color to visually highlight all parameter variations, making it incredibly intuitive and user-friendly. Plus, you can view the similarity results of value comparisons between parameters from those two elements\n  Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to experience a whole new level of efficiency with our latest addition to the Revit Add-in manager!\"\n  Open Source : https://github.com/chuongmep/RevitAddInManager\n  Documentation : [How to use Compare Parameter Element](https://github.com/chuongmep/RevitAddInManager/wiki/How-to-use-Compare-Parameter-Element)\n  #OpenSource #addinmanager #bim #autodesk #revitapi\n  /Users/jta/a/doc/revit/tbc/git/a/img/ch_compare_element.png\n\n- Revit database explorer (RDBE)\n  https://github.com/NeVeSpl/RevitDBExplorer\n  mentioned last year\n  https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/immutable-uniqueid-and-revit-database-explorer.html#3\n  The fastest, most advanced, asynchronous Revit database exploration tool for Revit 2021+.**\n  Yet another [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) like tool. RevitLookup was an indispensable tool to work with Revit API for many years. But now, there is a better tool for the job. Let me introduce you to RDBE and its capabilities. RDBE not only allows us to explore database in a more efficient way thanks to querying, but also to modify Revit database through ad hoc scripts written in C#.\n  - [query Revit database](#query-revit-database-with-rdq-revit-database-querying)\n  - [script Revit database](#script-revit-database-with-rds-revit-database-scripting)\n    - [ad hoc SELECT query](#ad-hoc-select-query)\n    - [ad hoc UPDATE command](#ad-hoc-update-command)\n  - [filterable tree of elements and list of properties and methods](#filterable-tree-of-elements-and-list-of-properties-and-methods)\n  - [easy access to Revit API documentation](#easy-access-to-revit-api-documentation)\n  - [edit parameter value](#edit-parameter-value)\n  - [extensive support for ForgeTypeId](#extensive-support-for-forgetypeid)\n  - [better support for Revit Extensible Storage](#better-support-for-revit-extensible-storage)\n  - [easier work with Element.Geometry](#easier-work-with-elementgeometry)\n  - [dark and light UI themes](#dark-and-light-ui-themes)\n  - [more advanced tree view](#more-advanced-tree-view)\n  - [snoop Revit events](#snoop-revit-events-with-rem-revit-event-monitor)\n  - [snoop updaters](#snoop-updaters)\n  You can always use an alternative tool that offers access to Extensible Storage Scheme.

To find XY plane holes:\n\n- Make Space surface polygons\n  with [shapely.Polygon](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon)\n- Make Space polygons from Space surface polygons\n  with [shapely.union_all](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.union_all.html#shapely.union_all)\n- Make Level surface polygons from Space polygons\n  with [shapely.union_all](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.union_all.html#shapely.union_all)\n- Ask shapely for\n  the ['interiors' attribute](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon) for\n  a sequence of rings which bound all existing holes in Level surface polygons.\n\nNext step is to correlate holes with Spaces.\nThis is the trickier part in my opinion.\nGoing in plan is to use polygons as defined by Space wall outlines as truth data.\nNot sure how this will mesh with current Ripcord Engineering gbxml workflow.\nTime will tell.\n\nMany thanks to Jake for the great pointer and nice example."
