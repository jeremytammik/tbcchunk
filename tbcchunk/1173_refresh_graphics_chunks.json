Therefore, if you need the palette to refresh, you have to refactor the application around some modeless concept and give the palette a chance to update regularly.</p><p>Regarding the 'possible several ways' to trigger graphical refresh listed above:</p><ul>\n<li>Committing a sub-transaction and transaction group does absolutely nothing in that regard.</li>\n<li>Regeneration might, but probably does not trigger anything in most cases, since regeneration itself is a pure DB operation.</li>\n<li>Committing a transaction mostly does trigger UI update, but probably not all of all possible UI items and controls.</li>\n<li>RefreshActiveView should trigger necessary UI refresh, naturally.</li>\n</ul><p>The 'zero move' trick that apparently works in some other CAD systems is not recommended.\nIf committing a transaction does not work, this would not help.</p><p>The properties palette does not update to the current situation if an external command is running.</p><p>In summary, the approach illustrated by the DisplacementElementAnimation SDK sample is probably best.</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
