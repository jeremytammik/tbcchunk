I develop for the Revit API (I love your blog) and I wondered if you might find the following talk we gave at AU of interest?\nIt's about automated publishing from Revit using a bridge we built to InDesign. It's pitched at around the level of tech understanding that your blog covers (C#, OOP and some .NET) so I think it might be a good match for your readers. \n\nhttps://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/One-Click-PDF-Model-Reports-Connect-Revit-InDesign-API-2019\n\nI'd love to know what you think! \nRegards,\nOllie\n\nOne-Click PDF Model Reports: Connect Revit to the InDesign API\n\nJeremy Tammik  8:09 AM\nthank you for your appreciation! i'll take a look. if you are interested in describing in writing some of the more interesting Revit API programming challenges your faced and how you solved or worked around them, that might make a nice wrapper for it.\n\nJeremy Tammik  8:15 AM\nlater... i read the hand-out. it is rather light on the technical details and solutions. i like the topic and the gist of the thing, though. if you would care to write in more detail about how to hooked up revit with insight and share some code snippets from the hardest steps it would certainly be of general interest. thank you.\n\nOliver Green sent the following message at 5:12 PM\nThanks for reading! We have a Github with some useful starter code on it (since model reviews tend to be quite company-specific we didn't want to dictate how to do it so much as just give useful code examples and principles for others to adapt as suits them). \n\nThere's some starter code on our Github and I'm happy to bring across the several other code examples we showed in our presentation if that would be helpful! \nhttps://github.com/AhmmTools/AU2019/blob/master/InDesignSampleAU2019.cs\n\nThe main challenges weren't really Revit API-specific. They were more to do with working around the InDesign API. However, since the talk is aimed at beginners I've gone into as much detail as possible so others could attempt to recreate what we demoed. It might make for a nice case study in learning how to connect Revit to other software (in this case using COM).\n\nIf you think there's anything we're missing or should clarify I'll be happy to try and get some stuff together.\nMany thanks to Ollie for documenting and sharing this!\n\n\ntwitter:\n\nAutomated PDF report via InDesign COM API, view and create real-time interactive 2D sketch Booleans in the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon http://bit.ly/autosketchpdf\n\nToday, we highlight two contributions by Håvard Leding and Oliver Green\n&ndash; 2D Boolean interactive real-time sketch viewer\n&ndash; Single-click automated PDF report via InDesign\n&ndash; Abbreviated table of technical contents...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nAutomated PDF report via InDesign COM API, view and create real-time interactive 2D sketch Booleans in the #RevitAPI\n\nhttp://bit.ly/autosketchpdf\n\nToday, we highlight two contributions by Håvard Leding and Oliver Green:\n\n- 2D Boolean interactive real-time sketch viewer\n- Single-click automated PDF report via InDesign\n- Abbreviated table of technical contents...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n\n-->"
