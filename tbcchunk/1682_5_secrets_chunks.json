Never initiate your coding project from an external IDE. Rather use Revit Macro Manager, then switch to a third-party IDE such as Visual Studio. This process sets everything up for you with relative paths which is critical if end user has not installed Revit on C drive. 3m:55s\n2. Use `Invoke` to run external commands instead of embedding references. This will prevent many hours watching the Revit splash screen when restarting. 6m:55s\n3. Always use modeless forms rather than modal ones, i.e., `Show` instead of `ShowDialog`. This allows for freedom of movement for the end user and opens the potential for creating a dockable panel in the future. 12m:40s\n4. Like Russian dolls, encase your database interactions inside transactions, which are in turn encased inside a try-catch, which in turn is encased inside an external event.  This nesting is the hardest thing to get your head around but absolutely necessary. 17m.15s\n5. Iterate rapidly, and seek peer review as early in the project as possible. I've found canvassing somebody elseâ€™s opinion early, can radically change the initial design intent and 'mental image' I had of my add-in. \n\nVery many thanks to Joshua for sharing his extensive Revit API experience, both here and in many other helpful comments and discussion threads!"
