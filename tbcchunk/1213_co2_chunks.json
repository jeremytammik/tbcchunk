    "chunk_text": "<h3>Hackathon, Climate and my CO<sub>2</sub> Footprint</h3><p>Last week, I attended an interesting and rather sobering presentation on sustainability by\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niko_Paech\">Niko Paech</a> entitled\n\n<a href=\"http://www.globalmarshallplan.org/news/interview-mit-niko-paech-befreiung-vom-berfluss\">Befreiung vom Überfluss</a> –\n\nliberation from excessive abundance –\n\nthe German title is shorter and sounds better, for a change.\n\n<p>That prompted me to have a look at <a href=\"#3\">my own CO<sub>2</sub> footprint</a>.</p>\n<p>This just happened to coincide more or less with the\n\n<a href=\"http://time.com/3414633/peoples-climate-march\">\nPeople's Climate March</a> taking\n\nplace simultaneously\n\n<a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/climate-change-marchers-rally-berlin-nyc-n208391\">all around the world</a>,\n\nincluding\n\n<a href=\"http://www.zeit.de/wissen/umwelt/2014-09/klimawandel-weltweite-demonstrationen\">ten thousand participands in Berlin</a>,\n\nGeneva and Zurich.</p>\n<p>Before getting to that, let me mention our own busy ADN weekend activities taking place at the same time, holding the worldwide <a href=\"#2\">Autodesk Exchange AppStore Hackathon</a>.</p>\n<p>At least this was a virtual event, avoiding the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused by most modern forms of fast travel.\nMore on the sobering aspects of that below...</p>\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n<h4>Autodesk Exchange AppStore Hackathon</h4>\n<p>We held the Autodesk Exchange AppStore Hackathon this weekend.</p>\n<p>The entire ADN DevTech teacm was online round the clock, chatting, supporting, presenting and hacking together with participants from all around the world.</p>\n<p>Here are my previous descriptions of this with all the details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/autodesk-exchange-apps-hackathon.html\">Autodesk Exchange Apps Hackathon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/job-opportunities-events-plans-and-planes.html\">Job Opportunities, Events, Plans and Planes</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are direct links to the\n\n<a href=\"http://exchangeapphack.com/agenda\">agenda</a> and\n\n<a href=\"http://exchangeapphack.com/agenda\">home</a>.</p>\n<p>We also held an own internal contest at the same time, the first ever DevTech hackathon challenge.\n\n<p>I am looking forward to hearing more about the results from that.</p>\n<a name=\"3\"></a>\n<h4>My Personal and Professional CO<sub>2</sub> Footprint</h4>\n<p>I am rather shocked, I must say.</p>\n<p>I was previously not aware of the tremendous effect of air travel on my personal CO<sub>2</sub> footprint.</p>\n<p>I checked it using an online calculator.\nI started out by searching the Internet for\n\n<a href=\"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=co2+footprint+calculator\">co2 footprint calculator</a> and\n\nended up using the one provided by\n\n<a href=\"http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx\">Carbon Footprint Ltd</a>.</p>\n<p>I do not use much energy myself for most things.\nI do share a car with a friend, which obviously causes more emissions than travelling by bicycle, train and bus as I would otherwise.\nI heat my house with wood, archaically.\nHere is my very rough personal summary, excluding airline travel, in metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.13 – Bus and rail travel</li>\n<li>0.25 – House, including heating (wood), cooking (natural gas) and electricity</li>\n<li>0.45 – Car</li>\n<li>1.35 – Secondary, meaning food and financial services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This adds up to 2.26 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub>, which is actually pretty OK.</p>\n<p>The target footrint per human being to reduce the impact on the climate lies somewhere between two and three tons per person per year, so I am actually already within that range – discounting airline travel.</p>\n<p>The average Swiss footprint today is over five tons, and the average developed nation one over ten.</p>\n<h4>How could I reduce this?</h4>\n<p>I checked what I could possibly do to reduce this.</p>\n<p>I already am vegetarian, so the only possible reduction food-style-wise would be switching to a vegan diet.</p>\n<!--\nYour Carbon Footprint:\nHouse\t0.25 metric tons of CO2e\nFlights\t0.00 metric tons of CO2e\nCar\t0.00 metric tons of CO2e\nMotorbike\t0.00 metric tons of CO2e\nBus & Rail\t0.13 metric tons of CO2e\nSecondary\t1.35 metric tons of CO2e\nTotal = 1.73 metric tons of CO2e\n\nYour footprint is 1.73 metric tons per year\nThe average footprint for people in Switzerland is 5.47 metric tons\nThe average for the industrial nations is about 11 metric tons\nThe average worldwide carbon footprint is about 4 metric tons\nThe worldwide target to combat climate change is 2 metric tons\n\nYour Carbon Footprint:\nHouse\t0.25 metric tons of CO2e\nCar\t0.45 metric tons of CO2e\nBus & Rail\t0.13 metric tons of CO2e\nSecondary\t1.35 metric tons of CO2e\nTotal = 2.26 metric tons of CO2e\n-->\n<p>Well, to my surprise, switching from vegetarian to vegan food would save 0.3 tons.</p>\n<p>Another surprising possible improvement offered by this particular calculator consists in switching from using a 'standard range of financial services' to not even having a bank account; that would save 0.4 tons.</p>\n<p>Obviously, not travelling at all by car would save 0.45 tons.</p>\n<p>As said, all of that seems quite OK to me.</p>\n<p>Now comes the bad part, though.</p>\n<h4>Air Travel</h4>\n<p>I travelled by air privately a couple of times, and much more for business.</p>\n<p>One private flight was a return trip from Zurich to Stockholm.\nThe CO<sub>2</sub> footprint for that flight alone is 0.25 metric tons.</p>\n<p>I also flew privately one-way from Tenerifa to Basel (0.52) and return to Marrakesh (0.43).</p>\n<p>Those three flights together cause 1.2 tons, about half the rest of my entire yearly budget.</p>\n<p>The really bad part for me is business travel, though.</p>\n<!--\n\n0.25 metric tons:\tEconomy class direct return flight from ZRH to ARN\n1.01 metric tons:\tEconomy
