It's helping me a lot.\n\n**Answer 3:** While editing this blog post, I found three previous related  articles:\n\nI am in the process of editing this thread for a blog post. I found three existing related blog posts:\n\n- [User MEP Calculation Sample](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/user-mep-calculation-sample.html)\n- [User MEP Calculation Sample on GitHub](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/user-mep-calculation-sample-on-github.html)\n- [External Services](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/12/external-services.html)\n\nThe third of these on Arnošt Löbel's class SD10752 on Revit External Services at Autodesk University 2015 is especially interesting:\n\nIt includes another Revit MEP calculation external service sample for a pressure drop calculation.\nIt was implemented specifically for this AU class and uses external commands to add and remove the calculator.\nA proper calculator would be implemented as an `ExternalDBApplication` with no external commands involved.\nApparently, at the time, the Revit 2014 UserMepCalculation sample was superseded by this one and should be replaced.\nHowever, I have not compared them myself, nor looked at the new SDK sample that Reynaldo points out.\n\nMany thanks to Reynaldo for his very kind and competent support in this area!"
