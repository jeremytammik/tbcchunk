    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Purge Unused using eTransmitForRevitDB.dll\n\nLast month, we\ndiscussed [several approaches to automating the purge command](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/02/purge-unused-and-etransmit-for-da4r.html).\n\nNow Emiliano Capasso,\nHead of BIM at [Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel](https://www.citterio-viel.com),\nshared an even better one,\nexplaining [why the Revit Purge‚Äã command is an act of love](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-revit-purge-command-act-love-via-api-emiliano-capasso),\nor <i>Perch√© il comando \"Purge\" di Revit √® un atto d'amore</i>:\n\nI'm writing this hoping it will be useful for all BIM Managers, Head of BIMs, BIM Directors, etc. around the world.\n\nThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying is the mantra of Marie Kondo, and the Japanese chain MUJI even published a book named ‚ÄúCLEANING‚Äù with hundreds of photos of cleaning activities all over the world.\n\nAn organised life is key and so why our models should be a mess?\n\nPurging, cleaning the models is the key of maintaining a high-quality standard, and for us delivering state of the art BIM Models is the priority.\n\nMessy models are problematic, all of our systems work around the clock with automations and data extractions to our BI dashboards to monitor KPI.\nBut as most of our architects are deeply caught in the design process and they forget to keep a tidy model, but our BIM department is here to help.\n\nBut with more than 40 active projects, how could we purge (3 times) manually every one of the 500ish models that we have?\n\n####<a name=\"2.1\"></a> The Purge via API Method\n\nTons of words have been spent about Purging in Revit via API, which is apparently impossible, cf.,\nthe [latest post on the topic](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/02/purge-unused-and-etransmit-for-da4r.html)).\n\nThere are lots of workarounds, such as <b>PerformanceAdvisor</b> and <b>PostableCommand</b>, but none of which was satisfying me.\n\nSo I was wondering, how the marvellous <b>eTransmit</b> addin made by Autodesk is actually Purging the models whilst transmitting?\n\nSo I went looking into the folder, found the .dll and in our addin referenced the <b>eTransmitForRevitDB.dll</b> and looked into its <b>public</b> methods:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/purge_unused_etransmit_1.jpeg\" alt=\"eTransmitForRevitDB.dll public methods\" title=\"eTransmitForRevitDB.dll public methods\" width=\"600\"/> <!-- 1152 -->\n</center>\n\nWow.\n\nCould that be so easy?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/purge_unused_etransmit_2.jpeg\" alt=\"eTransmitForRevitDB.dll public methods\" title=\"eTransmitForRevitDB.dll public methods\" width=\"600\"/> <!-- 1085 -->\n</center>\n\nYes.\n\nBelow the snippet:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  public bool Purge(Application app, Document doc)\n  {\n    eTransmitUpgradeOMatic eTransmitUpgradeOMatic\n      = new eTransmitUpgradeOMatic(app);\n      \n    UpgradeFailureType result\n      = eTransmitUpgradeOMatic.purgeUnused(doc);\n      \n    return (result == UpgradeFailureType.UpgradeSucceeded);\n  }\n</pre>\n\nJust create an instance of `eTrasmitUpgradeOMatic` passing the `Application` and call its method `purgeUnused` passing the `Document`;\nthat will return an `UpgradeFailureType`.\n\nNow you have your model purged (3 times also).\n\nSo satisfying.\n\nMany thanks to Emiliano or his research and nice explanation!"

Marin, Switzerland!\n\nThe office later moved a few km away to Neuchatel, and the camel remained in the new office as a mascott, a landmark.\n\n- 2017... Autodesk European headquaters close and move to Dublin.\n\nBut The Camel didn't like it and decided to remain fidel and stay right here...\n\nFor about 5 years he stays with Coral and Francesco, and tonight it has find a new home... guess where :)\n\nThe Camel is now with our family in the coldest village of Switzerland... Long Life to the Camel!\n\nClaudio Ombrella adds: Nice. Let me take the opportunity to share the story of the camel.\nIt was January 1993 when I joined the Marin, Switzerland office from Autodesk in Milano.\nThe Autodesk office was located at the first floor of the number 14b of the Av. Champs Montant.\nAll people driving to find the office did it from the West side: at the ground floor there a Persian carpet shop named <i>Tapis d'Orient</i>.\nThey had put a camel, better say <i>the camel</i> outside the office.\nIt quickly became the 'signpost' to arrive to the office: 'our entrance is by camel' used to say our colleague Sheila Ahles to any visitor needing instructions.\n\nOne day the shop closed and the camel became orphan.\nBut not for so long, because Autodesk employees pulled the camel into the office.\nAnd it became the mascot with its own badge that was regularly reprinted at every company logo change!\n\nIn 1994 we moved to the Puits Godet office and the camel moved too.\nWith the years it deteriorated a bit and then Bodo Vahldieck loaded on his VW Multivan and took it home for a complete restore.\nThen it came back to the office in perfect shape.\n\nIn 2015 my team opened a job and a young person applied for it, so we invited for an on-site interview.\nWhen the person saw the camel he said to me: ‚Äúand you have the camel? I am the son of the shop Tapis d‚ÄôOrient, I am so surprised to see it again‚Äù.\n\nThank you, Nicolas, for giving a new life to our old friend, the camel.\n\nJohn C.: The camel was first on the list of assets to be moved from Marin to Puits-Godet!\nThanks for bringing such good memories! \n\nLisa Senauke: James Carrington and I arrived when the Marin office had just opened and we were among the first 5 or 6 to arrive\n&ndash; Kern (and John Walker) Hans, Sheila, James, and I &ndash; who else? Creighton?\nWhen we were campaigning to be chosen to work in Switzerland, one of my proudest moments was when Hansi said to me, while I was pondering if we would get to go, and if there would be a job for me as well.\nHans looked at me and said, \"Lisa, where I go, YOU go!\" ü•∞ And I did!\nThe Camel was standing proud and tall by the entrance of the building, welcoming us to our new home!\nFor me, it was a Jungian peak experience!\n\nRaquel Aragon√©s: I had completely forgotten about the camel.\nI was there from 1992-3 to 1997!\nLong live the camel!"
