It was another solid quarter for the AEC business. Continued adoption of BI​M in the building and infrastructure industries drove growth of the Building Design and Infrastructure Design Suites. Multiple deals across geographies were closed with important and strategic customers, including Nabholz, TBI Holdings, KHIDI, AMEC and Japan Central Rail, showing the strength of the portfolio in every segment.</p><p>While The Building Coder is normally not interested in any such nitty-gritty financial details, I thought I would still pick out a couple of AEC and Revit related highlights for you:</p><ol>\n<li>Revit 2016’s scalability and performance improvements made a difference for our customers. But don’t just take my word for it, this quote is from one very happy customer, \"I have our 1.2 GB Architecture Model of a hospital opened in Revit 2016, and all I can say is 2016 is reDONKulously fast. Insanely. And our models are intensely detailed in terms of modelling geometry. 2016 refreshes views (now multi-core) in a stupid fast way.\"  ReDONKulously, his word, not mine!</li>\n<li>Solar analysis for Revit downloads more than doubled in the last month, and Lighting Analysis also continues to grow at 30% average per month.  According to Elizabeth Ratner of Little (Architects), \"...As I keep telling you, it’s been a game-changer for our firm.\"</li>\n<li>BIM 360 continued to deliver solid billings growth with 19% Y/Y net new billings growth.  And BIM 360 Plan (formally Project Falcon) is now being used by Suffolk Construction (pilot part of their recent EBA) who plan to use it on a mixed-use high rise in Boston. This project will construct one of the tallest buildings in Boston. DPR also began live pilots on several projects including Apple HQ and Disney World. The Apple project is a joint venture with Skanska and the Disney project is the first IPD (Integrated Project Delivery) project in the hospitality sector. BIM 360 Field added Daily Reports that gives users mobile daily project reports.</li>\n</ol><a name=\"3\"></a>"
