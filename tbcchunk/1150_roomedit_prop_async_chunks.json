    "chunk_text": "<h4>Falling into the Async Trap Again</h4><p>One of the things I struggled with in my initial roomedit implementation last year was the asynchronous response to database queries.</p><p>The solution I ended up with was to implement cascading response handlers: submit the second query within the function handling the response to the first, and so on.</p><p>I fell into the same trap now again.</p><p>I implemented the following function save_doc to store a modified document:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n// save a furniture document\n\nfunction save_doc(fdoc) {\n  if( fdoc.hasOwnProperty('loop') ) {\n    delete fdoc.loop;\n  }\n  db.saveDoc( fdoc,\n    function (err, data) {\n      if (err) {\n        alert(err);\n      }\n    }\n  );\n}\n</pre><p>It is called from this helper method that retrieves modified element properties from a form, updates and saves the document, and then sets a new window location, back to where we came from:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n// save modified element properties\n\nfunction save_properties(fdoc,do_save) {\n  if(do_save) {\n    var a = fdoc.properties;\n    var keys = jt_get_keys( a );\n    var n = keys.length;\n    var modified_count = 0;\n    for( var i=0; i&lt;n; ++i ) {\n      var key = keys[i];\n      var val = a[key];\n      var key_id = unspace(key);\n      if( 'w' == val[0] ) {\n        var w = $('#' + key_id);\n        var val2 = w.val();\n        if( val2 != val.slice(2) ) {\n          ++modified_count;\n          fdoc.properties[key] = 'w ' + val2;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if( 0 &lt; modified_count ) {\n      save_doc(fdoc);\n    }\n  }\n  var rid = fdoc.roomId;\n  window.location.href = url + '?roomid=' + rid;\n}\n</pre><p>This implementation worked fine when testing on a local database on the mac, but not on Windows.</p><p>I even saw an error message flash up sometimes, with no possibility to pause it to read the message or otherwise track it down.</p><p>After some debugging on both systems, using both Firefox and Chrome, I suddenly realised what the problem was.</p><p>If save_doc is called, an asynchronous new thread to store the modified document via a RESTful database call is launched.\nSetting the window location href property immediately afterwards interferes with that process.</p><p>The situation obviously only appears if some property is modified and the save_doc function is called.</p><p>Here is the updated implementation resolving the problem, by setting the window location within the database response handler if that path is taken, and in the main thread (as before) otherwise:</p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n// save modified element properties\n\nfunction save_properties(fdoc,do_save) {\n  var modified_count = 0;\n  var url_room = url + '?roomid=' + fdoc.roomId;\n\n  if(do_save) {\n    var a = fdoc.properties;\n    var keys = jt_get_keys( a );\n    var n = keys.length;\n    for( var i=0; i&lt;n; ++i ) {\n      var key = keys[i];\n      var val = a[key];\n      var key_id = unspace(key);\n      if( 'w' == val[0] ) {\n        var w = $('#' + key_id);\n        var val2 = w.val(); // equals w.attr('value');\n        if( val2 != val.slice(2) ) {\n          ++modified_count;\n          fdoc.properties[key] = 'w ' + val2;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    if( 0 &lt; modified_count ) {\n      if( fdoc.hasOwnProperty('loop') ) {\n        delete fdoc.loop;\n      }\n      db.saveDoc( fdoc,\n        function (err, data) {\n          if (err) {\n            console.log(err);\n            alert(JSON.stringify(err));\n          }\n          window.location.href = url_room;\n        }\n      );\n    }\n  }\n  // bad boy!\n  // cannot execute anything important here,\n  // because that will interfere with the async\n  // callback function execution in save_doc.\n  //var rid = fdoc.roomId;\n  //window.location.href = url + '?roomid=' + rid;\n\n  if( 0 == modified_count ) {\n    window.location.href = url_room;\n  }\n}\n</pre><p>With that in place, and numerous other little snags addressed and resolved, all works fine now.</p><p>The room editor implements round-trip display and editing of both non-graphical and graphical properties – element parameter values and family instance location and rotation.</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
