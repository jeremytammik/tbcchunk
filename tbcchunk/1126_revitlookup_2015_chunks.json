It compiles successfully, generating\n<a href=\"zip/revit_lookup_2015_warnings_01.txt\">0 errors and 24 warnings</a>.</li>\n<li>Fixed a few of the deprecated API usage occurrences:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Rewrote FamilyUtil.GetFamilySymbol using GetFamilySymbolIds instead of Symbols.</li>\n<li>Ditto in TypeSelectorForm.GetAvailableSymbols.</li>\n<li>Ditto in Importer.UpdateFamilySymbol.</li>\n<li>Rewrote TestElements.ViewToNewSheetHardwired to use ViewSheet.GetAllPlacedViews instead of ViewSheet.Views.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Updated the version number to 2015.0.0.0.</li>\n</ol><p>The fixes are currently marked with a comment:</p><pre>\n  // jeremy migrated from Revit 2014 to 2015:\n</pre><p>That will probably be removed again soon, since the same information can be easily gleaned from the version control system.</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
