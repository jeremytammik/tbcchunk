It uses machine learning in order to exploit the Connection Density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. \n    - [ISWC 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03825.pdf)\n    - [Demo](https://earldemo.sda.tech)\n    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/EARL)\n- SQG 0.1: This is a SPARQL Query Generator with modular architecture. SQG enables easy integration with other components for the construction of a fully functional QA pipeline. Currently entity relation, compound, count, and Boolean questions are supported.\n    - [ESWC 2018](http://jens-lehmann.org/files/2018/eswc_qa_query_generation.pdf)\n    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/SQG)\n- AskNow UI 0.1: The UI interface works as a platform for users to pose their questions to the AskNow QA system. The UI displays the answers based on whether the answer is an entity or a list of entities, Boolean or literal. For entities it shows the abstracts from DBpedia. \n    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/AskNowUI)\n- SemanticParsingQA 0.1: The Semantic Parsing-based Question Answering system is built on the integration of EARL, SQG and AskNowUI.\n    - [Demo](http://asknowdemo.sda.tech)\n    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/SemanticParsingQA)"
