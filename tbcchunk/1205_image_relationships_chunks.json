    "chunk_text": "<h3>Debugging and Maintaining the Image Relationship</h3><p>The Revit database contains a number of\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/undocumented-elementid-relationships.html\">\nundocumented relationships</a>,\n\nand it can be challenging and useful to discover them.</p><p>Christian Tonn of <a href=\"http://www.kubit-software.com\">kubit</a> presents a powerful method to determine and maintain such a relationship using an officially supported approach instead:</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible to get the ImageType object from an image you inserted in the Revit document with Document.Import?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Not directly!</p><p>I am using the Import method:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">bool</span> Import(\n    <span class=\"blue\">string</span> file,\n    <span class=\"teal\">ImageImportOptions</span> options,\n    View view,\n    <span class=\"blue\">out</span> <span class=\"teal\">Element</span> element);\n</pre><p>It only returns an Element object, which has no parameters attached – I used RevitLookup to check – nor can it be cast to anything useful, e.g. ImageType.\n\n<p>However, I can query Revit for all ImageType classes, and it really is possible to read the right Bitmap object out of the appropriate instance.\n\n<p>But how to connect the element returned by the Import method with the appropriate ImageType instance?</p>\n<p>The Element holds the image position in the view and the ImageType holds the Bitmap without position.</p>\n<p>I need both.</p>\n<p>Luckily, both items have the same Element.Name in the database, the image filename.</p>\n<p>I implemented a solution to determine and maintain the missing relationship like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Start a TransactionGroup.</li>\n<li>Start a first transaction.</li>\n<li>Import the image with a unique filename:</li>\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"teal\">String</span> tmpFilename = System.IO.<span class=\"teal\">Path</span>.GetTempPath()\n  + <span class=\"maroon\">\"kubit_\"</span> + <span class=\"teal\">Guid</span>.NewGuid().ToString() + <span class=\"maroon\">\".png\"</span>;\n \nmDoc.Import( tmpFilename, options, newView,\n  <span class=\"blue\">out</span> element );\n</pre>\n<li>Attach an extensible storage Entity to the returned image element:</li>\n<pre class=\"code\">\nEntity additionalData = newEntity(\n  MyImageSchema.GetSchema() );\n \nelement.SetEntity( additionalData );\n</pre>\n<li>Commit the first transaction.</li>\n<li>Search the Revit database for all ImageType objects.</li>\n<li>Use them to populate a dictionary mapping the Name property value to the ImageType instance: Dictionary&lt;string, ImageType&gt; nameImageTypeMap.</li>\n<li>Retrieve all Element objects returned by the Import method in step 3 using an ExtensibleStorageFilter.</li>\n<li>Start a second transaction.</li>\n<li>Loop through all the elements and add the ImageType information to them using the dictionary:</li>\n<pre class=\"code\">\nEntity additionalData = elem.GetEntity(\n  MyImageSchema.GetSchema() );\n \n<span class=\"blue\">if</span>( additionalData.IsValid() )\n{\n  <span class=\"green\">// Find correspondence between ImageType and </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// Element (first has image, second has additionalData)</span>\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( !nameImageTypeMap.ContainsKey( elem.Name ) )\n    <span class=\"blue\">continue</span>;\n \n  <span class=\"teal\">ImageType</span> image = nameImageTypeMap[elem.Name];\n  additionalData.Set&lt;<span class=\"teal\">ElementId</span>&gt;( <span class=\"maroon\">\"ImageTypeId\"</span>, image.Id );\n  elem.SetEntity( additionalData );\n}\n</pre>\n<li>Commit the second transaction.</li>\n<li>Commit the TransactionGroup.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After this you can easily retrieve the image elements using an ExtensibleStorageFilter and also determine their associated ImageType instanced using the element id stored in ImageTypeId.</p>\n<p>I am so happy I could figure this out.</p>\n<p>I really hope this will be improved in some future release of the Revit API.</p>\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n<h4>Element Lister
