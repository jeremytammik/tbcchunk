    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"6\"></a>RDBLink and Exporting data from Revit\n\nNow for some pure Revit API oriented topics as well.\n\nAn obvious and frequently asked question is how to export data from Revit.\n\nIt came up again, prompted by an update to the ancient Revit API discussion forum thread\non [Revit Server REST API and Project Data Exporting](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/revit-server-rest-api-and-project-data-exporting/m-p/3810739) and\na new thread\non [support in exporting database](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/need-support-in-exporting-database/m-p/5602871):\n\n**Question:** Is there a way to get all information regarding a model or project in a transferable format?\n\nI have heard of ODBC links and DBLink, but I'm looking for an API enabled way to get data and then push it into a secondary system.\n\nJSON, CSV, XML I can work with any format and do any of the necessary scrubbing and ETL leg work.\n\n**Question 2:** I want to create a desktop application that can export RVT data to a SQLServer.\n\n**Question 3:** We are building a plugin in C# using API that exports project data to our SQL server. DBLink has been good so far but now we need to enhance and make it feature rich for our users.\n\nCan you provide source code for DBLink please?  If it's in open source, or guide us in right direction. Or some method in which we are able to transfer all the project data direct to our SQL server.\n\nBasically what we are looking is a simple UI that users can export Revit project data into our SQL server; we are making certain reports based on this export.\n\n**Answer:** First of all, good luck with this. It sounds like you've got quite a lot of work ahead of you.\n\nI'd recommend taking a look at the source code for RevitLookup.  It provides a good starting point for figuring out how to access the data for different kinds of elements.  Unfortunately, you'll notice is that not all model data is accessible through the API.\n\nThe other addin you'll want to take a look at is the Revit DB Link addin.  It's also from Autodesk and available to subscription customers for free.  To automate the export, you may be able to use some sort of UI Automation.  It may be able to export more data than what you'd normally be able to access through the API, but I suspect it would have the same limitations.\n\nYou may also want to take a look at programs like Codebook and Ideate BIMLink, which have some pretty powerful data import/export capabilities.\n\nHere are some other relevant SDK samples and topics on The Building Coder:\n\n- FireRating SDK sample\n- Some of the [Adn Xtra Labs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra)\n- ArchSample SDK sample\n- RoomSchedule SDK sample\n- The [FireRatingCloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud) cloud based FireRating sample\n- The entire [Export category](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/export)\n\nReturning to the RDBLink sample mentioned above, its source code was originally provided as part of the Revit SDK, before it was promoted to an official subscription package.\n\nHere is the [last Revit SDK version of RDBLink](zip/RDBLink_2010.zip) for Revit 2010.\n\nI have no idea how useful it might be to migrate it to Revit 2016.\n\nIt will show you all the principles, at least.\n\nI find it much easier and more effective to export to a cloud-based NoSQL database rather than SQL, nowadays, though.\n\nMore on this anon.\n\nFinally, here are some pretty ancient articles discussing various uses of RDBLink:\n\n- [Integration with a Database or ERP System](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/integration-with-a-database-or-erp-system.html)\n- [Adding a Column to RDBLink Export](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/adding-a-column-to-rdblink-export.html)\n- [Retrieving Project Parameters](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/retrieving-project-parameters.html)\n- [Parameter Access and Scheduling](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/parameter-access-and-scheduling.html)\n- [Exporting Parameter Data to Excel, and Re-importing](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/exporting-parameter-data-to-excel.html)\n- [Survey and Project Base Point](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/survey-and-project-base-point.html)"
