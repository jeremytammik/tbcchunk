We'll review the kinds of apps you will be able to build and their\nAPI architecture so that you can get ready to use Design Automation for Revit in your own\napplications.\n\nDesign Automation API for Revit is a Forge service that will allow developers to access the 'business logic' of Revit on the cloud. Like Design Automation API for AutoCAD, developers can create client applications which speak to the Revit engine via our REST API. Developers will be able to automate existing workflows or create new cloud workflows.\n\nBecause Design Automation API for Revit is a Forge service, you can take advantage of other Forge services to easily connect your applications together.\n\nToday, you can use and read the existing documentation for [Design Automation API for AutoCAD](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v2/overview)."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3.2\"></a> How do you use the service?\n\nLike other Forge services, you’ll create a Forge client application which will call our REST API endpoints. You can use any language which can make REST calls. This client application will also do any 'front-end' work you need &ndash; displaying UI to an end-user, for example. Overall, the\nsystem is similar to Design Automation API for AutoCAD and the endpoints should be familiar to someone familiar with that service.\n\nIn addition to the client application, you will create one or more Revit add-ins to execute against the Revit engine. You will upload these to the Design Automation service and your client application will refer to them when invoking the service. (You can keep them private or public depending on what you want.) We’ll talk more about these add-ins in the next section."

(It's your choice whether to make this public or private.)\n3. You define an 'activity' with the Design Automation API.

This is a specific invocation of an activity, indicating specific input files and an output location.\n3. The Design Automation service downloads the input files.\n4.

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3.5\"></a> Things to consider when using the service\n\nThere are a few important things to keep in mind as you plan for how to use the service.\n\n- You will only have access to Revit’s 'business logic'. You won’t have access to Revit’s UI. In technical terms, this means you can call RevitAPI.dll functions but not RevitAPIUI.dll functions. (Or, you won’t have access to the Autodesk.Revit.UI namespace.) You can put whatever UI you want in your client application, but your Revit add-in shouldn’t display UI.\n- There is no intermediate feedback. Your add-in will run to completion once it starts, so it’ll need to have all input up front. There is also no way to get partial results. You can check the status of a job but you’ll get all results at the end.\n- There is no persistence between jobs. If a job is meant to be a follow-on to a previous job, you’ll need to send the second job with any info it needs to set up the proper state. Every job is run in a clean environment."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4\"></a> How can I create a Revit add-in which works with Design Automation API?\n\nYour full client application may not be a Revit add-in specifically. It may be a website or a standalone application. But part of your system will be a Revit add-in. This add-in is what will be executed against Revit in the cloud when you invoke the Design Automation API.\n\nEven though the Forge service isn’t public today, we can explain the steps to create a Design Automation-ready add-in now. You can use these steps to convert an existing add-in or to create a new one."

    "local_header_href": "#a-name41a-decide-what-your-add-in-will-do",
    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4.1\"></a> Decide what your add-in will do\n\nWhen you send a job to Design Automation API, it will go into a queue. When it reaches the head of the queue, it will run to completion and then return. Everything the job needs to run must be available to it at start time. As such, add-ins should be able to do self-contained chunks of work.\n\nThis does not mean the add-in can only do simple tasks, just that all the inputs need to be present up front. For example, take an add-in which does nightly data extraction from a model. It might export all views to images, convert all schedules into the company’s format, create charts on what changes have happened in the model over the past day, and update cost estimates. You could structure this as one add-in or as four, depending on what you want to do and whether you think you might reuse the pieces elsewhere. One add-in means only having to open the model once. Four add-ins lets your client application send the work as four different jobs and you may get intermediate results faster."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4.2\"></a> Create an IExternalDBApplication\n\nMost Revit add-ins are external commands (IExternalCommand) or external applications (IExternalApplication.) There is a third kind, the IExternalDBApplication, which is an add-in which can run without Revit’s UI logic. You will not have access to Revit’s UI logic as part of Design Automation API, so you will need to create an IExternalDBApplication.\n\nYour add-in will have access to all the functionality in RevitAPI.dll but none of the functionality in RevitAPIUI.dll. You should avoid using other UI libraries as well. There is no way to click on dialogs or message boxes; the system will effectively hang if you try to present one.\n\nIf you have an existing app, splitting into UI and logic layers will allow you to run against both desktop Revit and Design Automation API. You can preserve your existing UI functionality within an IExternalApplication which communicates with your IExternalDBApplication."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4.3\"></a> Determine what inputs you need\n\n'Inputs' to a Design Automation job can include simple parameters and files of any type. The framework will put any input files into the cloud machine’s working directory before running your add-in.\n\nAs mentioned, a Design Automation job must have all the information it needs to run at launch time. There is no ability to send more data or call back to the user in the middle of a job. This can present a problem if your add-in expects to do partial calculations and then ask the user for more input.\n\nIn this situation, you can either attempt to collect the input up front, or set up your client application so that it run several smaller jobs. Here are two examples:\n\n- If your application warns a user when an operation is expected to take a long time, you might have a user setting indicating how long to wait before cancelling.\n- If your application runs into errors while trying to generate geometry, you might return early, ask the user to make corrections, and re-submit the job."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4.4\"></a> Use our bridge library to be notified when Design Automation is executing\n\nWe will provide a small library with an event your add-in can subscribe to in order to be notified when the Design Automation service is ready to run your add-in. Your add-in should create an event handler and execute its functionality inside. (The add-in will be registered in Revit normally, but this provides an entry point for starting your code.)\n\nUntil the library is available, you can get a similar effect for testing purposes by subscribing to Revit’s ApplicationInitialized event. You should not do this if you are actually running your add-in against Design Automation, because we will do more system setup after the ApplicationInitialized event is raised. Additionally, the framework will use the success/failure parameter of the event to determine whether the job succeeded."

We will ignore or take a default action for user-facing dialogs. We will also ignore warnings. However, we do not take any default actions for errors. You should either create an event handler for the FailuresProcessing event, or implement an IFailuresProcessor.\n\nYou must ensure that it handles all possible warnings, errors and other failures gracefully.\n\nThe Building Coder recently discussed this topic using the StairsAutomation SDK sample:\n\n- [About handling failures](zip/da4r_au_2018_FailureProcessor.html)\n- [Sample failure processor module `FailureProcessor.cs`](zip/da4r_au_2018_FailureProcessor.cs)\n- [Swallowing StairsAutomation warnings](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/swallowing-stairsautomation-warnings.html)\n- [Auto-Run an add-in for Design Automation](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/auto-run-an-add-in-for-design-automation.html)"
