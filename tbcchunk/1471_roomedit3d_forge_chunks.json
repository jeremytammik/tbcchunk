This is my first and favourite sample, extremely simple, quite impressive functionality, shows all you need to know if you do it all yourself. Con: nowadays, [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) is not quite as hip and easily accessible as [node.js](https://nodejs.org).\n- [FireRatingCloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud) and\n\tthe [fireratingdb](https://github.com/jeremytammik/firerating)\n  [node.js](https://nodejs.org) web server driving\n  a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org) database demonstrating real-time round-trip editing of Revit element shared parameter values.\n  This is the simplest and hippest sample of all and a great starting point.\n- [Roomedit3dApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/Roomedit3dApp) and\n  the [roomedit3d](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d)\n  [Forge Viewer](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2/overview) extension\n  demonstrating interactive movement of furniture family instances in the viewer and updating the Revit BIM in real time via\n  a [socket.io](http://socket.io) broadcast. This is the first sample demonstrating a real-time round-trip connection from\n  the [Forge](http://forge.autodesk.com) viewer back to the Revit BIM."

(for a360 access?)\n- 2-legged oauth? (for box access?)\n- A360 file download and upload\n- Box file download and upload\n \nAnything else?\n \nThose are six question marks... could you provide six yes/no answers to them, please?\n\n**Answer:** Yes, I did indeed publish very short blog post on [Box &amp; Forge](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/09/box-forge.html) describing them.\n\nPlease read that first, then the following answers you request:\n \n- 3-legged oauth? (for a360 access?) &ndash; yes, using the NPM package for the [DM Data Management API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview).\n- 2-legged oauth? (for box access?) &ndash; actually 3-legged too, using the [BOX npm package](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/data.management-nodejs-integration.box#packages-used).\n- A360 file download and upload &ndash; yes, again using the NPM package.\n- box file download and upload &ndash;  yes, using box NPM package\n \nHere are the integration `.js` file functions:\n \n- [`sendToBox`](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/data.management-nodejs-integration.box/blob/master/server/data.management.box.integration.js#L42)\n- [`sendToAutodesk`](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/data.management-nodejs-integration.box/blob/master/server/data.management.box.integration.js#L108)\n \nThe `.tree.js` files implement the respective jsTree functions, cf. the [server folder](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/data.management-nodejs-integration.box/tree/master/server)."

Your readme should have something like the following:\n\nMac OSX/Linux (Terminal):\n\n<pre>\nnpm install\nexport FORGE_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL]\nexport FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=[YOUR CLIENT SECRET]\nnpm run dev\n</pre>\n\nWindows (use `Node.js command line` from Start menu):\n\n<pre>\nnpm install\nset FORGE_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL]\nset FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=[YOUR CLIENT SECRET]\nnpm run dev\n</pre>\n\nOpen the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\n<b>Important:</b> do not use `npm start` locally, this is intended for PRODUCTION only with HTTPS (SSL) secure cookies.\n\nAs you can see above, `npm start` should be reserved for production (e.g. deploy to heroku). This is basically to enforce cookie security ([see sample here](https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-3leg.nodejs-template/blob/master/server/server.js#L32)).\n\nThere are two other env variables that you need and that mostly do not need to appear in the readme, but do use these names anyway (it will help on rule #3):\n\n- `FORGE_CALLBACK_URL` &ndash; that’s the name we use on Dev Portal, cf. [this config.js sample](https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-3leg.nodejs-template/blob/master/server/config.js#L24)\n- `PORT`  &ndash; use 3000, as per common NodeJS practice, cf. [sample here](https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-3leg.nodejs-template/blob/master/server/server.js#L45)\n\nImportant: if you have a basic sample, there is no need to use different naming. If you really absolutely need an extra step, it’s ok, but add a note explaining why."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"6\"></a>Forge Viewer Access to Revit 2D Views\n\nPeople keep asking about how to access different Revit views in the Forge viewer.\n\nWe already discussed [access to the 3D views](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/07/selecting-views-for-forge-translation.html),\nwhich is kind of tricky.\n\nAccess to the 2D views is much more straightforward, though, as we can see in the StackOverflow question raised by Greg Bluntzer\non [Autodesk Viewer: Suggestions for 2D view of floor view](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39533258/autodesk-viewer-suggestions-for-2d-view-of-floor-view/39533388#39533388):\n\n**Question:** I have a Revit file and am able to convert it via the cloud to a SVF and view it in the 3D viewer. It works both as conversion of the `.rvt` file directly and as an export from the NavisWorks add-in exporter.\n\nMy question: I want the user of my app to also be able to see the floor 2D view as you can in Revit.\n\nI have looked through all the manifest files and do not see a F2D for the floor view.\n\nWhat do you suggest I use for the 2D view? Note that I will have many drawings to process and view so I would prefer not to have to export a DWG for each view then convert those. I am hoping there is a special setting I can pass to the converter that will create the 2D views.\n\n(Note : I also want to be able to highlight and texture the rooms of this view dynamically. So I will need to be able to access the geometry like you can in the 3D viewer).\n\n\n**Answer:** Afaik all 2D views defined in the Revit project file are automatically translated and included in the Forge output.\nHave you looked at the LmvNav sample, for instance, also known\nas [LMV Nav Test](https://calm-inlet-4387.herokuapp.com)?\n\nIt displays both 2D and 3D views. \n\nNote the list of available 2D views in the Secondary View dropdown:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/lmvnavtest.png\" alt=\"LmvNavTest default 3D and selected 2D secondary view\" width=\"650\">\n</center>\n\nIt even links the elements in the two views so that anything selected in one is highlighted in the other:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/lmvnavtest_select.png\" alt=\"LmvNavTest selected element synchronisation across views\" width=\"619\">\n</center>\n\nYou could check from where it gets the 2D streams.\nThe source is available from\nthe [LmvNavTest GitHub repository](https://github.com/JimAwe/LmvNavTest).\n\nI think you select whether you want a 2D or a 3D stream when you supply it to the viewer.\n\n**Mikako adds:** Here is a [user interface tool for selecting views to publish from a Revit project on A360](https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/02/selecting-views-to-publish-revit-project-on-a360)."
