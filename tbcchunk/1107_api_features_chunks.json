However, I would like you to (try) understand that there are always important reasons for the decisions the Revit R&amp;D makes and serious considerations are always part of the decision process. For one, we believe that having a .NET API shell over Revit native internal provides most users with more stable platform, and that applies to Revit API developers as well as the end users that enjoy their add-ins. In my personal opinion, the .NET environment makes the API also more approachable to users that aren't professional developers. At the same time, we do not restrict what advanced developers can do in their add-ins. If they wish to delegate some heavy calculations to other modules written in unmanaged languages, they quite easily may do that. In fact, Revit supplies some of its own add-ons that are written as multi-language, the cloud renderer being one example.</p>\n<p>As for multithreading, I actually do not believe our users think we ignore their wishes and requests out of spite. I know they understand that putting together a multithreaded environment is not trivial. It is not easy to write such applications from scratch. It is far more difficult to rewrite an old application to be completely multithreaded. And even with that difficulty being always part of the equation, some applications are just mode difficult to multithread than others. I am not saying impossible, but sometimes it is just too darn hard. Revit actually has many internal components that are threaded; however, trying to thread access to a database as complex and tiered as Revit's data model is another task all together.</p>\n<p>I'd like to add one comment about the complexity (and, well, ugliness) of the Revit API. I think the same could be said about Revit itself when comparing it with other applications. Revit is indeed different. I do believe there are trivial tasks that would take minutes to do in AutoCAD while they can take an hour easily in Revit. On the other hand, however, I would not have to be pressed hard to come up with tasks that take minutes in Revit, but days in AutoCAD. I believe the same sentiment can be extended to other platforms and applications. There are users who swear to be much faster on their Macs then others can be on their Windows, and vice versa. And of course, the Unix hard-core crowd swears to be much more efficient with their command lines than all the GUI lovers combined. :-) But at the end of the day it is all about the right tool for the right tasks, isn't it.</p>\n<p>The Revit API may not be perfect.\nThere are and always will be plenty of things we would like to be different, and would be, if we had our way and time to work on them.</p>\n<p>Many thanks both to Adrian for putting these facts and his feelings so clearly and bluntly, and to Arnošt for picking them up in the same vein.</p>\n<p>I hope and believe that this will prove really useful to anybody faced with these issues, whatever their reactions and thoughts may be.</p>\n<a name=\"3\"></a>\n<h4>Revit API Compatibility Across Versions</h4>\n<p>Another aspect of the Revit API that is disconcerting to some developers is its lack of backwards compatibility.</p>\n<p>Unlike AutoCAD, which provides backwards API compatibility across years and even decades, the Revit API sometimes deprecates certain sub-optimal properties, methods and classes one year and removes them the next, triggering questions such as this one on\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Revit-API-Compatibility-Across-Versions/m-p/4818483\">\nRevit API compatibility across versions</a> raised\n\nin the Revit API discussion forum by Terry Dotson of\n\n<a href=\"http://www.dotsoft.com\">DotSoft</a>:\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> We have been developing add-ons for AutoCAD for 20+ years and are thinking about testing the water in Revit, mainly the Architectural version.</p>\n<p>If a .NET based plugin is produced for a given version, will it typically work in future releases?</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I am sorry to say that the answer to your first and main question is simply no.</p>\n<p>Generally, a Revit add-in requires recompilation to run on a new major release of Revit.</p>\n<p>Say you have implemented and installed your add-in for and on Revit A, and the user updates to a new major release Revit B.</p>\n<p>Due to the fact that the .NET framework isolates the add-in from the underlying API to a certain extent, all the functionality in the Revit B API that remains unchanged from Revit A will continue working.</p>\n<p>However, unlike AutoCAD, Revit does not maintain backwards API compatibility.</p>\n<p>For instance, access to the endpoints of a curve element used to be via the indexed EndPoint property, taking an argument 0 for the start and 1 for the end endpoint.</p>\n<p>In C#, this property was automatically translated to a method get_EndPoint, whereas in Visual Basic, it remained unchanged, an indexed property EndPoint.</p>\n<p>In Revit 2014, this property was declared deprecated and replaced by a new method GetEndPoint that is and remains a method under all circumstances and in all languages.</p>\n<p>In the next major release of Revit, the deprecated method will be declared obsolete and removed.</p>\n<p>From that moment onward, a Revit 2012 add-in trying to access the EndPoint property (or get_EndPoint method in C#) will cease working.</p>\n<p>So Revit provides much less backwards API compatibility than AutoCAD.</p>\n<p>Users are encouraged to update in a more timely fashion.</p>\n<p>One important tip for AutoCAD developers is to try to\n\n<a href=\"http://www.marcandangel.com/2013/09/02/5-things-you-should-know-about-letting-go\">\nlet go of the expectations</a> that working with AutoCAD APIs has fostered ...\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/02/bim-versus-free-geometry-and-product-training.html\">\nRevit is a different animal</a> and\n\nthe experience and expectations coming from any other CAD system can be just as much a hindrance as an asset, especially when thinking about\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/porting-an-autocad-application.html\">\nporting an AutoCAD application</a>.\n\nBasically, the workflows are so different that a straight port will almost never make any sense whatsoever.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Revit API is much smaller and simpler than AutoCAD's.\nAn experienced programmer should be able to get going within a few hours, and understand everything there is to know within a few days, which is definitely not possible in AutoCAD.</p>\n<p>One last thing: in Revit add-in development, it is more important than in AutoCAD to have a good product and user workflow understanding before beginning to think about any application development, both because the workflows in real BIM projects are more complex, and because the API more closely mimics and supports the user interface functionality.
