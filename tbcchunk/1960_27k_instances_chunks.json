The process memory maxes at 1.5GB on my machine. Are there any recommendations on how to improve the performance? I was thinking that splitting the task into chunks of not more than 200 FamilyInstances might produce some benefits but I'm wondering if the time required to commit and start the transactions would erode them. Any advice is much appreciated. (edited) \n  Scott Conover\n  we used to have batch creation routines for FamilyInstances.  But those were only needed because the API used to regenerate after nearly every model change, and this could be much less performant when not necessary.  So when we switched those became unneeded and were removed (mostly, I see some remnants but not useful ones).\n  Some of the problems I suspect relate to adding 27000+ expanded elements.  There is no way to unexpand the elements in memory once they are expanded.   If this is a batch/non-visible process maybe saving/closing the model and reopening periodically might help with the overall performance and memory consumption?   If the model is visible this might be disruptive to the user.\n  Actually, we do still have a routine in place, NewFamilyInstances2() - horrible name - takes a collection of family instance creation data objects.  I suspect it won't perform any better than individual calls, but perhaps...\n  Paolo Serra\n  I'll give it a go and see if produces any better results, I'll let you now. Thank you all for your prompt response\n  Jacob Small\n  If it's a regeneration issue perhaps placing empty families first to reduce (if not remove) the regeneration time, then swapping for the family you want to use?\n  Paolo Serra\n  I used the NewFamilyInstances2() in batches of 200, without committing the transaction, and it was able to generate the families in 4:48 seconds, very promising. Now I need to see how it handles updating the parameters of the instances, would be nice to have a similar method (edited) \n  Paolo Serra\n  @Jacob Small  FYI regeneration is not an issue for now but I'll keep your suggestion in case it becomes a problem, thanks\n  Paolo Serra\n  with further optimization on the logic the instances went down to about 22000 and even setting 3/4 parameters from Excel on each instance and running interpolations takes not more than 3.5 minutes, that is a great result.\n  Scott Conover\n  Now I'm wondering what type of optimizations are in that NewFamilyInstances2() method.  I thought it was just trying to avoid excess regenerations...\n  Paolo Serra\n  they basically want to create a Voxel representation of the soil based on boreholes samples, if there is some kind of vectorization happening in NewFamilyInstances2() it would be nice to have a similar approach to edit parameters in bulk\n  image.png\n  Tamas Badics\n  Looks like NewFamilyInstance() commits a subtransaction for each call. That may be the main reason why it is much slower than the batch NewFamilyInstance2() method. Still it may be worth debugging fully.\n  Rahul Bhobe\n  Is the Revit model generally slow after having placed so many instances or only the act of placing the instances? If the model in general slow, does closing the file and opening it improves the performance? Is there a sample revit file for the image you posted?\n\n- Set Parameter to Vary by Group Instance\n  https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/set-parameter-to-vary-by-group-instance/79882\n  Mark.Ackerley\n\n- grammarly\n\ntwitter:\n\nA Forge hackathon coming up, IFC property sets, NewFamilyInstances2 creates 27000 instances in bulk and parameters that vary by group instance in the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon https://autode.sk/bulkinstances\n\nToday, we talk about Forge, IFC, family instance creation in bulk, parameters that vary by group instance and a handy spell checker\n&ndash; Forge hackathon\n&ndash; Forge IFC exporter\n&ndash; NewFamilyInstances2 creates 27000 instances\n&ndash; Set parameter to vary by group instance\n&ndash; AI-enhanced web-based spell checker...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nA Forge hackathon coming up, IFC property sets, NewFamilyInstances2 creates 27000 instances in bulk and parameters that vary by group instance in the #RevitAPI\n\nhttps://autode.sk/bulkinstances\n\nToday, we talk about Forge, IFC, family instance creation in bulk, parameters that vary by group instance and a handy spell checker:\n\n- Forge hackathon\n- Forge IFC exporter\n- NewFamilyInstances2 creates 27000 instances\n- Set parameter to vary by group instance\n- AI-enhanced web-based spell checker...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n-->"
