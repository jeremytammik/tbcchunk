Should it be JSON? If it needs to be JSON, then how I should write it to represent these point coordinates? \n\n**Answer:** The slightly more complex question is how to generate multiple output files.\n\nThat is answered by the article\non [how to generate dynamic number of output with Design Automation for Revit V3](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/how-generate-dynamic-number-output-design-automation-revit-v3).\n\nIn passing, it also mentions multiple input files, saying:\n\n> ... For the zipped input file, it's well documented at https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step6-post-workitem/, but for the output zipped result, it's not so clear...?\n\nTrying to follow that link, I note that it is out of date.\n\nThe updated link that worked for me is [forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step7-post-workitem](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step7-post-workitem).\nApparently, a new step was added to the tutorial after publishing the original article.\n\nLooking at the Forge documentation and [additional notes on input arguments](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step7-post-workitem/#additional-notes),\nI see the instructions on how to pass JSON input data directly in the workitem itself.\n\nI would assume that you can also use a different prefix instead of `data:application/json` such as `data:application/text` to pass in the data in its current form.\n\nPlease try that out and let us know how it works for you.\n\nAlternatively, you can just stay on the safe side and convert your text data to JSON format.\n\nThere are innumerable ways of doing so.\n\nThe most minimalistic and simple would look like this:\n\n<pre>\n  [1.002, 20,502, 21.706,\n  12.502, 5,502, 7.706,\n  21.002, 15,502, 14.706,\n  ...]\n</pre>\n  \nThat represents on single array of doubles.\n\nA slightly more structured approach might be to pass in an array of triples of doubles like this:\n\n<pre>\n  [[1.002, 20,502, 21.706],\n  [12.502, 5,502, 7.706],\n  [21.002, 15,502, 14.706],\n  ...]\n</pre>\n\nAs you see, it is not hard.\n\n**Response:** Many Thanks Jeremy. All nice help. I am going through it. I will make it JSON, to be on the safe side :)"
