This class covers techniques to efficiently\nextract elements and information from a Revit\nmodel. The new collector framework introduced in\nthe 2011 release includes much more flexibility than\nbefore. Along with the flexibility comes some\ncomplexity.

It discusses all MEP model components\nsuch as mechanical and electrical systems, ducts,\npipes, fittings, connectors, and the new cable trays,\nconduits, and panel schedules. Topics include in-depth\nanalysis and traversal of systems, automatic\nsplitting of parts, obstruction avoidance, routing\nautomation, and conduit and cable tray layout. We\nwill discuss the standard Revit MEP SDK sample\napplications, as well as custom ones to convert\npipes to conduits; layout of cable tray elements and\nfittings; display of electrical system hierarchies in a\ntree view; and automatically calculate, size, and\nreport performance of an HVAC system that is\nbased on room requirements.\n\n<p>As an 'Unconference', this session is actually not a lecture or class at all, but rather a discussion group co-led with Martin Schmid to share and discuss Revit MEP application development experiences among peers.\nI am very excited to see how this one goes, and also how Martin will juggle his many commitments to fit this one in!\n\n<p>I am very much looking forward to these sessions and hope to see you in Vegas!\n\n<p>Until then, lots to prepare, as usual...\n\n<p>By the time you read this, I will have left on yet another vacation, this time northwards, to go sailing along the coast of Norway and Sweden, from Stavanger to Göteborg.\nThat will be the last one for a while, I promise!\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
