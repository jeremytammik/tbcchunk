But the geometry of the family instance only can be retrieved by GetOriginalGeometry method, and there is any reference can be got. How can I add the dimension to detail items by API?\n \n[A] For Revit 2018, we have new capabilities to get the standard references for family instances. I haven’t tested specifically with detail items, but I believe this should work for them as well:\n \nCheck out the\nsection [API access to `FamilyInstance` references](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2018-api.html#3.19)\nin [What's New in the Revit 2018 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2018-api.html):\n\n> The following new methods have been added to enable easy access to FamilyInstance references that correspond to reference planes and reference lines in the family. Some use the options in the new enumeration FamilyInstanceReferenceType as input to identify \"Strong\" or \"Weak\" references or specific positional references in each of the 3 coordinate directions (as determined by the possible values of parameter \"Is Reference\" of reference planes and parameter \"Reference\" of reference lines in families).\n \n- FamilyInstance.GetReferences()\n- FamilyInstance.GetReferenceByName()\n- FamilyInstance.GetReferenceType()\n- FamilyInstance.GetReferenceName()\n \nPrior to Revit 2018, I don’t believe there is a technique to get at the available references.\n \nThis also resolves the older case 11909355 *Parametric family instance placement* and the wish list item CF-1271 *API wish: need a way to relate view specific geometry in project with particular ref plane in family* that it gave rise to, which has now been closed as fixed.\n \n<center>\n<img src=\"img/family_instance_ref_plane.png\" alt=\"Family instance reference plane\" width=\"433\">\n</center>"
