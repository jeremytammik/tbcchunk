If not, `GetInstanceCutoutFromWall` will fail!\n\nHere is Jan's full explanation in all its gory detail:\n\n> **Question:** I find that the `ExporterIFCUtils` `GetInstanceCutoutFromWall` is a fine way to get the outer CurveLoop of a window or a door, but sometimes for some strange reason it does not work, and no helpful error message is supplied.\n \n> I attached:\n\n> - A [simple test project including only one wall containing two windows](zip/GetWindowCurveLoopTest.rvt)\n> - [Sample code that demonstrates the problem](zip/GetWindowCurveLoop.zip)\n\n> I hope someone can explain why `GetInstanceCutoutFromWall` works on one window but not on the other.\n \n> **Answer:** Now I determined when the error occurs!\n\n> It happens whenever an opening family (door or window) is defined without an opening cut.\n\n> Openings must have an `OpeningCut` object. If not, `GetInstanceCutoutFromWall` will fail!\n\nThis helps explain some issues people had with this method in the past, and also fits into several existing topic groups, such as use\nof [the frequently overlooked Revit API utility classes](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.52) on\none hand, determining wall openings in general, gross versus net areas and volumes in particular, on the other:\n\n- [Opening geometry](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/01/opening-geometry.html)\n- [The temporary transaction trick for gross slab data](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/the-temporary-transaction-trick-for-gross-slab-data.html)\n- [Retrieving wall openings and sorting points](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/12/retrieving-wall-openings-and-sorting-points.html)\n- [Wall opening profiles](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/12/wall-opening-profiles-and-happy-holidays.html#3)\n- [Determining wall opening areas per room](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/determining-wall-opening-areas-per-room.html#4)\n- [More on wall opening areas per room](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/more-on-wall-opening-areas-per-room.html)\n- [Two energy model types](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/01/family-category-and-two-energy-model-types.html#3)"
