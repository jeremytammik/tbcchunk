I see two more of the same in\nthe [revitapidocs page on FindInserts](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/58990230-38cb-3af7-fd25-96ed3215a43d.htm).\n\n- Albano Gheller (8 months ago): What are shadows and shared embedded?\n- Александр Пекшев (2 years ago): what is Shadows??\n\nI asked the development team and they replied:\n\nAn internal `WallShadowCutoutGStep` is created when 2 walls are joined, e.g., by Modify &rarr; Geometry &rarr; Join, and then a window is placed on one wall.\n\nIn that case, Revit will cut an opening on the other joined wall, as you can see in this picture:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/findinserts_wall_shadow_cutout.png\" alt=\"Wall shadow cutout\" width=\"490\"> <!--980-->\n</center>\n\nFor this API &ndash; `FindInserts`, here is\na [short demo recording](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/findinserts_include_shadow.gif) &ndash;\ni try to find the inserts on the joined wall but not the wall with the window:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/findinserts_include_shadow.gif\" alt=\"FindInserts demo\" width=\"640\"> <!--1279-->\n</center>\n\nThe window instance  with element id 354965 is returned if `includeShadows` is true, and nothing returned for false.\n\nMany thanks to Phil Xia for this detailed explanation!\n\n**Response:** Thank you for bringing light into the shadow &nbsp; :-)\n\nMakes much sense now.\n \n####<a name=\"4.1\"></a> Addendum &ndash; Meaning of includeSharedEmbeddedInserts\n\n**Question:** What's the meaning of the fourth argument, `includeSharedEmbeddedInserts`?\n\nI tried to create window, door, embeded walls, curtain walls, but couldn't find its effect on models.\n\n**Answer:** From the code, it looks as if `includeSharedEmbededInserts` finds the inserts whose host is a `HostObj` that is embedded in the current wall.\n\nFor instance, given a wall A with an embedded wall B, a door instance D hosted by B will be found in A if `includeSharedEmbededInsertsz is set.\n\n<!---\nHere is an example: In this model (see attached below), the wall (id=143992) has a wall (id=141718) embeded, and the door instance (id=226688) on it will be found by \n\nShengxi Zhang  3 days ago\nAttached a model with a macro in it.\nBinary \nfindInsertsSample.rvt\n5 MB Binary— Click to download\n\n/a/rvt/embedded_wall_instance.rvt\n\n```\n    [Window Title]\n    Revit\n    \n    [Main Instruction]\n    The file embedded_wall_instance.rvt was saved in a later version of Revit and cannot be retrieved in this version.\n    \n    [Close]\n```\n--->"

For an application macro, I imagine it would be a handful of files.\n\nYou could also consider deploying your code as a Dynamo package or\na [RevitPythonShell script](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell).\n\nThe RevitPythonShell installer is available as source code and demonstrates how you can deploy an add-in to any machine with a single click.\n\n**Response:** Macro seems a good idea if I can import them into our template file or just open each ongoing project and copy it in the project.\nStill, I will need to rewrite the add-in code for macro.\n\nDynamo would be great! But I'm writing code in C# as add-in.\nIs there an easy way to convert them to Dynamo nodes?\nAs I have heard, there are some differences between code for Dynamo node and add-in.\n\n**Answer:** I'm facing the same problem as you.\nAs said, you need to copy compiled files (.dll, .addin and maybe .pbd) to the target machine.\n\nI found a fairly easy way to achieve this using a batch file. It copies these file from a server to user's Revit addin directory:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n@echo off\nrem --------------------------------------------COPY FILE TO TARGET MACHINE-------------------------------------------\nrem /i option is needed to avoid the batch file asking you whether destination folder is a file or a folder\nrem /e option is needed to copy also all folders and subfolders\nrem /y option is needed to overwrite existing files without prompt \nif not exist \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2019\\\" mkdir \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2019\\\"\nDEL /F/Q/S \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2019\\\" > NUl   \nxcopy \"YOUR ADDIN DIRECTORY\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2019\" /i /e /y\npause\n\ndel %SCRIPT%\n</pre>\n\nIn my case, it does require the individual user to click on the batch file to download/update, but I reckon you could modify the code so that it copies to everyone's machine by one click from you.\n \n**Response:** I am also interested in this.\n\nWhat I have done in my office is to put the .dll in a read-only location in the server and I created a BATCH file to copy the .addin to each person's computer.\nThis way, I just need to go to their computer and click on the BATCH file.\nAnd if I want to make changes to the tools, I just have to overwrite the .dll in the server and everybody gets the update.\n\nHowever, I am not sure if this a good practice as many people are reading the same dll.\n\n**Answer:** Why not also copy the .dll file?\nI copy my .addin and .dll files from a location on our server to all BIM modellers' workstations using Group Policy, so I know that everyone will get an updated version if I just change the file on the server.\n\n**Response:** That is, in fact, a good idea.\nWhen I started my strategy I was new in the office and didn't know about the group policy.\n\nI will have a chat with the IT managers and ask them to do this.\n\nThanks!"
