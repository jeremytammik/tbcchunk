Use the ApplicationInitialized event instead.\nSubscribe to it during the OnStartup method of your external application, then from within the event's handler invoke the OpenAndActivateDocument method.</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n\nThx! I'll try this solution...</p><p>When I used the event ApplicationInitialized and the System.Diagnostics.Process.Start in the event handler, it works now.</p><p>Thx for ur kindness direction!!</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> by Matt:\n\nI'm not sure if I understand your suggestion to use the ApplicationInitialized event.\nWhile I agree that event is the right one to use for the timing of when it executes, it doesn't seem like we have access to the right contexts at the right time?</p><ul>\n<li>If we register it during startup, we're registering it against the ControlledApplication class.</li>\n<li>When we are in the callback after, we're in the callback of the ControlledApplication class.</li>\n</ul><p>When we're in that callback – how would we have access to the UIApplication object so that we could call OpenAndActivate?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong> by Arnošt:\n\nI may be wrong, but I think it works differently than what you guessed. The object inside the OnStartup is indeed a ControlledApplication, but it ought to be an Application instance as the sender argument of the ApplicationInitialized event handler. With that you will be able to construct an instance of UIApplication and use its methods.  (Unfortunately, most of us New Englanders are working from their homes  today due to a storm, and I am trying to limit my debugging sessions to a minimum! If it turns out it is not working for you as I suggested, however, let me know and ’ll debug it myself by tomorrow or Wednesday.)</p><p>Just as a side note: it does not matter whether an event handler subscribes to an event using ControlledApplication or Application. The repository of application event delegates are always with the Application instance (internally).</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n\nYou make it sound so easy...</p><p>Here we are, an hour or two

intended?</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n\nThanks!\nYou are correct; the sender of the ApplicationInitialized event callback is the Application (not the controlled application).\nSo my quest of a non-hacky way to transition between the ControlledApplication and the Application is finally solved!</p><p>Jeremy – I'm not sure that the reflection was actually necessary? Was that just exploration?</p><p><strong>Answer</strong> by Arnošt:\n\nPerhaps I made it sound simple because it is in fact rather simple. Indeed, as Matt already noted, no reflection is necessary.\nIn the OnStartup you get UIControlledApplication, from which you can get ControlledApplication (the latter always exists if the former does), and on that you subscribe to the ApplicationInitialized.\nKeep in mind you cannot cast a ControlledApplication to Application – that is the ControlledApplication’s very point of existence.</p><p>Then in the event handler the sender should be an instance of Application, which can be used to instantiate a UIApplication, on which the OpenAndActivateDocument method can be invoked. Like I said, quite simple. ;-) Each of the two methods is only a few lines of code.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n\nOh dear. What a waste.</p><p>Yes, of course, given the UIApplication constructor taking an Application argument, all is clear and the Reflection is not needed. I did not notice that, and what I described was the first alternative I could find  :-)</p><p>Well, well, apparently all roads lead to Rome after all... but it saves effort taking the easiest path.</p><p>For the sake of completeness and those that trust nothing but source code, here is the complete solution without using Reflection, showing just how short and simple it can be:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"blue\">class</span> <span class=\"teal\">App</span> : <span class=\"teal\">IExternalApplication</span>\n{\n  <span class=\"blue\">const</span> <span class=\"blue\">string</span> _test_project_filepath\n    = <span class=\"maroon\">\"Z:/a/rvt/CurvedWall.rvt\"</span>;\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">public</span> <span class=\"teal\">Result</span> OnStartup( <span class=\"teal\">UIControlledApplication</span> a )\n  {\n    a.ControlledApplication.ApplicationInitialized\n      += OnApplicationInitialized;\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">return</span> <span class=\"teal\">Result</span>.Succeeded;\n  }\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">void</span> OnApplicationInitialized(\n    <span class=\"blue\">object</span> sender,\n    <span class=\"teal\">ApplicationInitializedEventArgs</span> e )\n  {\n    <span class=\"green\">// Sender is an Application instance:</span>\n \n    <span class=\"teal\">Application</span> app = sender <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Application</span>;\n \n    <span class=\"green\">// However, UIApplication can be </span>\n    <span class=\"green\">// instantiated from Application.</span>\n \n    <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span> uiapp = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span>( app );\n \n    uiapp.OpenAndActivateDocument(\n      _test_project_filepath );\n  }\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">public</span> <span class=\"teal\">Result</span> OnShutdown( <span class=\"teal\">UIControlledApplication</span> a )\n  {\n    <span class=\"blue\">return</span> <span class=\"teal\">Result</span>.Succeeded;\n  }\n}\n</pre><p>The complete source code, Visual Studio solution and add-in manifest are provided in the\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/OpenProject\">\nOpenProject GitHub repository</a>,\n\nand the version described here is\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/OpenProject/releases/tag/2015.0.0.0\">\nrelease 2015.0.0.0</a>.</p><p>It could also be noted, for the sake of completeness, that in the majority of application events, the sender is the Application object.\nThere are only a handful (if at all that much) of events that are raised by the UIApplication.\nThose are more like exceptions to the rule, as documented in the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm in the SDK.</p>"
