    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Shock and Gripe\n\nAt first sight, Victor was not pleased at all with the radical changes.\n\nI think this is important to share our discussion on the first impression, since his sentiments are probably shared by other RevitLookup aficionados as well:\n\n> I wanted to make some changes in RevitLookup (actually fix the bug) and noticed the bad thing;\nafter Andrew's commit with serious changes, RevitLookup looks ugly.\nHe completely changed the algorithm of data retrieving, using `Reflection`, but lost some functionality.\nIn the latest version, for example, I cannot get symbol geometry. It's disabled.\nSo, the idea is good, bad the implementation needs to be improved :-)\nAnd I'll get send you pull request soon with bug fixed.\n\nOn second thoughts, luckily, things cleared up a bit:\n\n> Probably yesterday I was a bit emotional. Because my first opinion was &ndash; what the hell?\nEverything is absolutely different, not as usual, difficult to find a property, and I could not get the desired property `SymbolGeometry`.\nI found that the new version is very raw.\nLooking at it in more detail, I like the general idea to use reflection.\nIndeed, it allows to get more information and not worry about the new methods/properties in future versions.\n\n> My biggest concern is with the methods. We are getting the methods using reflection.\nAndrew gets all the methods without parameters and return type is not void.\nBut we cannot ensure the method is just a 'get' method.\nA method might modify something and return a value.\nFor example, `bool Remove() { // remove something return true; }`\n \n> Some issues:\nThe properties/methods are not sorted. In the previous version, they were not sorted either.\nBut as all the properties were added manually, the order looked more intelligent, like `Id` and `Name` at the top.\nWith reflection, the properties are sorted in the custom order and difficult to find a particular property.\nI think would be better to sort them. I'll do that, no prob.\n \n> `SymbolGeometry` is not populated because this is a bug.\nI've found where exactly in the code &ndash; `GeometryInstance` is cast to `Element`, but is not in fact derived from it.\nWill try to fix it myself or submit an issue on GitHub."

Method such as `Rotate`, etc., will return `false` when they cannot execute, which is what you are seeing. \n\n> This is one thing that I recognised early on as a potential issue but is not a problem &ndash; unless there is something I'm completely missing here. \nLet me know if you find anything to the contrary; otherwise, I still believe this version is safe. \n\n\nEver so many thanks again to Andy for his brave initiative and for Victor for his critical and constructive clean-up!"
