Learn how, and see how easy it is to get started.\n- Web Programming &ndash; \nDelve into topics from web application security to architecture to testing best practices, or brush up on the basics you need to transition from desktop to web programming.\n- Forge Industry Stories &ndash; \nTake in cross-category case studies showing how Autodesk partners and customers used Forge to solve real business problems, and what they learned along the way.\n- Construction Technology with Forge + BIM 360 &ndash; \nLearn how Forge and BIM 360 have been used to create countless apps across the construction industry, helping teams innovate, digitize job sites, minimize data loss and increase efficiency.\n\nI will be there, together with Kean and many other world-wide colleagues.\n\nYou can [register today via this link](https://www.rayseven.com/r7/runtime/autodesk/devcon2018/registration.visitor.php).\n\nAlso, again like Kean, my next stop is next week in Rome at\nthe [Forge accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com).\n\nI hope you can make it to one of our upcoming events as well."

Which is what I did when it didn't work.\n\nThe problem is caused by the built-in Typepad search module.\n\nJust for your information, the entire blog source code is also available in parallel in\nthe [tbc GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc),\nso you can always download from there to your own system and search there with full control and flexibility.\n\nAfter some in-depth research and JavaScript twiddling, I am now opening my own Google search window in a new tab in parallel with the dysfunctional Typepad search.\n\nI dove into the blog source code to determine and retrieve the search input text box and submit button and hijack it to open a second Google search window doing just that.\n\nHere is the code that I added to the site to achieve this:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n  window.onload = function(){\n    var form = document.getElementById('search-blog');\n    var submit = form.getElementsByClassName('btn')[0];\n    var searchinput = form.getElementsByClassName('form-control')[0];\n    submit.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n      var s = searchinput.value;\n      s = s.replace(/ /g, '+');\n      var url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q='\n        + s + '&as_sitesearch=thebuildingcoder.typepad.com';\n      //window.location.href=url;\n      var win = window.open(url, '_blank');\n      win.focus();\n    });\n  }\n  &lt;/script&gt;\n</pre>\n\nI initially tried to override the Typepad functionality completely using `window.location.href`, but that failed.\n\nTherefore, I open the second Google site search window in parallel and set the focus to that instead.\n\nBy the way, I found\nthis [ultimate guide to the Google search parameters](https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-google-search-parameters) useful\nto determine what URL arguments to add, i.e., `as_sitesearch`.\n\nFinally, I discussed the issue with Typepad, saying:\n\n> the built-in typepad search module does not work.\ni now implemented my own javascript version to open a google search engine in a separate tab.\nwhat can i do to make the built-in typepad search module work as intended?\nto see what i mean, please go to [thebuildingcoder.typepad.com](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com),\ntype `IExternalCommandAvailability` in the search input text box and click 'Submit'.\nthe built-in search reports that no results are found:\n\n> *No Results Found &ndash; Sorry, there were no results returned for “IExternalCommandAvailability” &ndash; please check your spelling, or try something less specific.*\n\n> i open a new tab with a google search engine limited to thebuildingcoder site, and it reports many results.\n\nTypepad answers:\n\n> Thank you for reaching out to us. We are aware search results are not displaying as expected, and we are currently working on an update to the search feature. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any other questions, please let us know.\n\nI have no other questions, thank you, Typepad.\n\nThank you very much, Matt, for pointing this out!"
