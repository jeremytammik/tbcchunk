What are Autodesk partners and customers doing with design Automation?  Automate. Automate. Automate.  From automating design to automating model checking and more.\n- Forge Model Derivative and Viewer using next generation “OTG” format.  This is all about an order of magnitude increase in model size and performance. Work with your largest models in the browser at “high speed” and on hardware limited mobile devices (phone, tablet, AR/VR and more).\n- New BIM 360 APIs.  Model Coordination (clash), Cost, Submittals, and more.\n\nThe Forge team will be present at the Conference and at your disposal to answer any of your questions, up close and personal help with your challenges.\nFace to face time is important when you are climbing the learning curve and driving change in your organization &ndash; so come and get face time with Autodesk decision makers and engineers &ndash; and share learnings with other developers just like you.\n \nConvince your manager today that he needs to send you to the Forge DevCon &ndash; and\nthen [register for the conference now](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/portal/myAccount.ww?pass=forgeDevCon).\nIt's only four weeks away!\n\nIf you already registered for AU, it’s easy to add your Forge DevCon pass for just $150 &ndash; go to\nyour [AU registration](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/portal/myAccount.ww?pass=forgeDevCon) and\nclick “Add a pass”. \nIn case you have questions about your registration, our AU customer service is ready to help,\njust [email autodeskuniversity@autodeskevents.com](mailto:autodeskuniversity@autodeskevents.com).\n\nQuestions (of any sort)? Unsure?\nWant to have a 1 on 1 meeting while I am in Las Vegas?\nPlease do feel free to reach out to me directly.\nJust [drop me an email](mailto:jim.quanci@autodesk.com) &ndash; or call/text me.\nReally.\n \nCheers,\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right; font-style: italic\">Jim Quanci\n<br/>Senior Director, Software Partner Development, Autodesk, Inc.\n<br/>+1-415-640-4461 (mobile)</p>\n \n<center>\n<img src=\"img/jim_quanci_sailor.png\" alt=\"Jim Quanci, sailor\" width=\"367\">\n</center>"

Adding to it, Infrastructure projects are complex and faceted in its very nature. With visual programming tools you as an engineer, modeller or drafter get a new set of tools that can be applied to a range of different production challenges for consultants, owners and contractors alike. This lab will look into how we can parametrically drive Infrastructure BIM-models using visual programming tools. We'll cover some basics, but also explore aspects of geometry, math and data handling that in sum can more or less directly be applied to live projects.\n\nSo, if you're an Infrastructure BIM'mer come attend this lab, and learn how things can be done better and faster than ever before!\n\n\n####<a name=\"3.2\"></a> Table of Contents\n\n1.
