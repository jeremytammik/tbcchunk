Close the iteration.\n- Iterate over excelWallInfo and determine the required wall types. Close the iteration.\n- Open a transaction.\n- Duplicate the required wall types.\n- Iterate over the walls that need modifying and do the dirty deed.\n- Commit the transaction.\n\n--->\n\n**Question:** I am thinking in develop a script that changes all walls' types' names based on properties of the wall types.\n\nI sometimes see a name of the type that mentions 30cm Thickness and does not match the real thickness of the wall type, so my script should generate the wall type name based on the function (exterior, interior , etc.), the material of each layer of the wall and thickness and the total wall thickness.\n\nFor example, `InteriorWall_Concrete-100` for a one layer interior wall and 100mm thickness, or, more complex,\n\n- `ExteriorWall_Concrete-100_Bricks-100_200`\n\nIs that against best practices?\n\nThat plugin would avoid having different naming systems and ensure that the name of the type matches the real properties... sounds a crazy thing for you? or super complicated task?\n\n**Answer 1:** For me, as a programmer, that makes perfect sense and is perfectly feasible.\nHowever, I am not a BIM expert and cannot advise you on best practices.\nI would suggest that you also raise that question in the generic architectural forum.\n\n**Answer 2:** I might be able to add a bit of info for you;\nmy primary job is Revit tech (and support) in an Architectural firm (I just do a little coding when needed to get things working the way we need them to) and I have worked as CAD/BIM Manager at a couple of firms over the many years and I can confirm:\n\nThat is an excellent idea and will greatly benefit those working in the model(s).\n\n**Answer 3:** This is one of the fundamental things we all want to do at some point: reduce what a type is to a string value of the main things that define it. The idea works fine until there is a certain minor detail which distinguishes two types. In the end, human beings use Revit models not robots. So, there is only a certain extent to which you can codify such things and it still be readable and fit on screen where it is read. What features are most important to represent and in which order, that is always the endless discussion.\n\n\n<!---\n\nHi @jeffreybo.liu ,\n\nI can't follow the code completely some context is missing, but from what I think it does I would not recommend it.\n\nCouple of things with the code / logic:\n\n1. It tries to Duplicate a WallType X each time with a Wall Type Named Y, this fails because Wall Type Y already exists.\n\nYou should first retrieve all walltypes and if Wall Type Y already exists it can't be recreated!\n\nImagine creating a second walltype \"EmptyName\", that won't work either.\n\n2. Why create a new Walltype altogether?, it's based on it's type properties, then just rename it.\n\ndo check if the name already exists, .... what action to take if it already exist??\n\n3. Level, what does this have to do with the Type name of a wall, from what I see the Level is stripped from the new name, so 2 walls with identical types but on different levels would have different names (?) in the ExcelWallInfo but would be renamed identicall, again each name can only exist once in project.\n\n4. The ExcelWallInfo list, how is this built, seems it doesn't take the layers, thickness, interior into account\n\n5. Model Groups; walls in groups can't have their walltype changed by API etc...\n\n6. Can't read the code clearly, (use the forums Code insert button), looks that the commit happens each iteration of the selected walls, call the Commit after all walls are processed.\n\n+ If all this could be corrected you would end up with a lot of WallTypes....and what about the description or other text fields?\n\nIf I would need to force a naming structure just iterate the WallTypes in the project and base it's name on the properties as total width (as in you're other post), with maybe a translation dictionary if certain materials(names) are used in layers.\n\nThis is one of the fundamental things we all want to do at some point: reduce what a type is to a string value of the main things that define it. The idea works fine until there is a certain minor detail which distinguishes two types. In the end human beings use Revit models not robots. So there is only a certain extent to which you can codify such things and it still be readable and fit on screen where it is read. What features are most important to represent and in which order, that is always the endless discussion.\n\nRegarding original post from 2014 by others the issue is likely related to:\n\n- Name cannot contain any of the following characters:\n<br/>(:01:&lt;&gt; ?'~\nor any of the non-printable characters.\n\n/Users/jta/a/doc/revit/tbc/git/a/img/invalid_symbol_characters.png\nPixel Height: 203\nPixel Width: 357\n\nThey are also using the name from GetType rather than Revit parameter value or API property i.e. not using something written specifically for RevitAPI but instead depending on a general programming feature (things inherited from object).\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n\n</pre>\n\n--->"
