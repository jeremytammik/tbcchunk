Creating railings is tedious if the aim is only to work on geometry.\n  We've done a lot of Geometry of this type. I guess you retrieve the geometry of the room with GetBoundarySegments.\n  I have never crossed a case where the arrangement of the BoundarySegments is not consecutive (and I've seen tens and my algos thousands) so I'm really curious (and sceptical) about that. \n  We made the choice to compute geometry using both internal and external tools (NetTopologySuite) because we needed to have boolean algebra and specific tools to work on Room boundaries, which we found tedious using XYZ.\n  Anyway I'm curious...\n  https://nettopologysuite.github.io/NetTopologySuite/index.html\n  ... sounds very interesting indeed! Thank you for pointing it out. Would you like to share some examples of using it in combination with the Revit API? This might make a brilliant article for The Building Coder and motivate many others to widen their horizon working with 2D geometry in the Revit API.\n  Ahah we did many things:\n  - automatically place furniture in housing (from beds, the easiest, to TV set, kitchen appliances and bathroom stuff)\n  - automatically place electric fixtures in housing (lights, switches, plugs) or HVAC elements (ventilation, heating)\n  - automatically recognize housing units and name Rooms from their characteristics\n  The first 2 examples use mainly simple geometric rules while the last makes an extensive use of boolean 2D operations.\n  And we are currently working on connecting 2 elements with for ex. cold water pipe, which is not that easy (more geometry there ;))\n\ntwitter:\n\nI am in Nairobi, Kenya, right now, getting to know the team here; new APS landing page, create RVT using APS and using NetTopologySuite with the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #ForgeDevCon https://autode.sk/nairobi\n\nI am writing this in Nairobi, Kenya, getting to know the team here; also, the new APS landing page just went live, and Benoit points out a useful geometric modelling library to help power your Revit add-in\n&ndash; DAS team in Nairobi, Kenya\n&ndash; NetTopologySuite in Revit add-ins\n&ndash; New APS landing page\n&ndash; You can create RVT using APS...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nI am in Nairobi, Kenya, right now, getting to know the team here; new APS landing page, create RVT using APS and using the NetTopologySuite geometric modelling library with the #RevitAPI\n\nhttps://autode.sk/nairobi\n\n- DAS team in Nairobi, Kenya\n- NetTopologySuite in Revit add-ins\n- New APS landing page\n- You can create RVT using APS...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n-->"

Without such a valid Revit API context, the API cannot be used. It is completely event driven, and only Revit can launch the necessary events.\nSo, for the desktop, this means you need to have a full Revit product installation and a running Revit session.\n\nHowever, you can make use of the [APS Autodesk Platform Services (formerly Forge)](https://aps.autodesk.com).\n\nThe APS Design Automation API for Revit enables you to create an RVT project file without installing Revit on your local machine.\nInstead, a Revit engine is launched in the cloud and executes your add-in code on a server, returning the resulting RVT file for you to download locally:\n\n- [APS Design Automation API](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview/)\n- [APS Design Automation API for Revit](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview/#design-automation-api-for-revit)"
