This is the inverse volume so you deduct each of these from the tile size to give you each partial tile size and its location.\nI speak in terms of volumes because volume is easy to determine from solids and then you can divide by tile thickness.\n\nAlso, I'm using the inverse because I know the boundary of the room to use for deducting from the overall set. I could do it the other way around (deduct the excess from around the room) but I would have to allow a border around the room to ensure all the excess tiles are deducted and this seems slightly more complicated in determining that border width (probably a tile size plus an allowance).\n\nI think where you start the tiling becomes arbitrary in a sense because rarely in reality are tiles set out on site to such precision. I imagine you usually start from the centre and work your way out to the edges so it gives the impression of symmetry.  I'm wondering how many variations you'd get by changing the tile offset i.e. if all the tiles are the same size do you cover the variations by offsetting through the tile unit dimensions? Do you then discount arrangements that lead to impractical tile sizes?\n\nIn the end, what area of tiles do you need to fill a room of 10m2? Workmanship will play a large part in how many tiles you need so costs are usually not that specific. It'll likely be 10m2 worth of tiles + tolerance because I can't sell you half tiles (you cut them).\nAlso, I'll sell you boxes of 20 tiles not individual ones.\nThen, there is colour variations in tiles; perhaps you have a pattern and you want to know how many of each colour?\n\n**Response:** Thank you for reply.\nWe are not considering tolerance part or the colour of different tiles as of now.\n\nI am thinking to do some different way.\n\nAssuming room is rectangular:\n\nI will get centre of rectangle.\n\nThen I fire a reference intersector in both directions (x,y).\n\nI know the size of the tiles (width,height).\nDivide reference intersector by length.\nThat returns the no of tiles in that line.\n\nMultiply by room dimension get total tiles.\n\nIf reference intersector is not divide equally, then last tiles are cut tiles; I will get total cut tiles by multiplying with length of room.\n\n**Answer:** Sounds like an approach but I'm not sure you need a `ReferenceIntersector` for a rectangular room.\n\nIf the room is rectangular then you just need to find the room boundaries with opposite or same vector direction and measure the distance between them to get your room size.\n\nThen, it's just as you say, dividing room dimension into tile dimension to give you a count.\nThe remainder is then the portion of cut tile at either end:\n\n5000 / 300 = 16.6666 recurring (16 full units).\n\n0.6666 * 300 = 200 (rounded) so a strip of 100mm at each end to close the gap.\n\nThat kind of thing?\n\nGrout tolerance is likely means to artificially increase the tile size dimensions by the grout width.\nWe do similar with reinforcement bars to get maximum spacing but we are then counting the gaps."

Sort the bins with respect to the area packed into them and their cost per unit area.\n- Step 4 (Reoptimization): Use the First-Fit-Decreasing heuristic to repack the removed items.\n- Step 5 (Solution update): If the new solution is better than the best known solution, update the best known solution.
