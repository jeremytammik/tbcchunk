For instance, this has led to the following added features related to the Idling and other events:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Control of the <a href=\"#2\">Idling event repetition</a>\n<li>Idling event with <a href=\"#3\">no active document</a>\n<li>New <a href=\"#4\">external events framework</a>\n<li><a href=\"#5\">RevitWebcam revisited</a>\n<li>Use of <a href=\"#6\">OpenAndActivateDocument in event handlers</a>\n<li><a href=\"#7\">Further information</a>\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n<h4>Idling Event Repetition</h4>\n<p>The Idling event has been changed to offer two different modes of behaviour. The default behaviour has changed, so pre-existing code that needs the original behaviour will have to explicitly select the non-default behaviour.\n\n<p>In the <b>default mode</b>, the event will be raised one single time each time Revit begins an idle session. Note that when the user is active in the Revit user interface, idle sessions begin whenever the mouse stops moving for a moment or when a command completes. However, if the user is not active in the user interface at all, Revit may not invoke additional idling sessions for quite some time; this means that an add-in may not be able to take advantage of time when the user leaves the machine completely idle for a period of time.\n\n<p>In the <b>non-default mode</b>, Revit keeps the idling session open and makes repeated calls to the event subscriber. In this mode, Revit will continue to make Idling calls even if the user is totally inactive. However, this can result in system performance degradation, because the CPU may remain fully engaged in serving Idling events.\n\n<p>You can specify the non-default Idling behaviour by calling the new <b>SetRaiseWithoutDelay</b> method on the IdlingEventArgs instance passed in to the event handler. This call has to be made each time the Idling event call-back is made. Revit will revert to the default single-call Idling behaviour as soon as this method is not called.\n\n<a name=\"3\"></a>\n<h4>Idling Event with no Active Document</h4>\n<p>In contrast to the Revit 2012 behaviour, the Idling event now is invoked even when there is no document active in Revit.\n\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>External Events Framework</h4>\n<p>The Idling event enables an interaction between Revit and an external asynchronous process. The external process cannot directly invoke any Revit API methods, but it can send a request to be processed by the Idling event handler next time it is raised. One common use of this has turned out to be supporting the interaction of a modeless dialogue with Revit. In this kind of scenario, the Idling event handler never has anything to do except when such a request has been submitted, so most of the calls to it will simply return immediately.\n\n<p>This interaction is supported much simpler and much more efficiently by the new external events framework. It operates similarly to the Idling event with default frequency. Instead of implementing an event handler and setting up the handler to do nothing when there is no activity in your dialog, you do the following instead:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Implement an external event, derived from the IExternalEvent interface.\n<li>Create an instance of your external event by calling the ExternalEvent.Create method.\n<li>When the external asynchronous process triggers an event that requires a Revit action to be taken, call the Raise method on the external event instance.\n<li>Revit will wait for an available Idling time cycle and call the external event Execute method.\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>This framework is useful for modeless dialogue developers, because you can skip the default no-op implementation when nothing has happened, and just tell Revit when there is some work to do. It saves on the time required for Revit to make repeated calls to the Idling event when there is nothing to be done.\n<p>This is the complete specification of the external event interface:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"green\">// An interface to be executed when an external </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// event is raised.</span>\n  <span class=\"green\">//</span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// An instance of a class implementing this </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// interface will be registered with Revit first, </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// and every time the corresponding external event </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// is raised, the Execute method of this interface </span>\n  <span class=\"green\">// will be invoked.</span>\n \n  <span class=\"blue\">public</span> <span class=\"blue\">interface</span> <span class=\"teal\">IExternalEventHandler</span>\n  {\n    <span class=\"green\">// Method called to handle the external event.</span>\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">void</span> Execute( <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span> app );\n \n    <span class=\"green\">// String identification of the event handler.</span>\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">string</span> GetName();\n  }\n</pre>\n<p>Here is an example snippet of code creating an instance of an external event and starting a new thread to drive it from the same application:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  _event = <span class=\"teal\">ExternalEvent</span>.Create( \n    <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">WebcamEventHandler</span>() );\n \n  <span class=\"teal\">Thread</span> thread = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Thread</span>( \n    <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">ThreadStart</span>( Run ) );\n \n  thread.Start();\n</pre>\n<p>Here is part of the implementation of the Run method making use of the external event and calling its Raise method to request its Execute method to be called, in which the Revit API can be used again:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n    <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> </span><span class=\"gray\">&lt;summary&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> External webcam event driver.</span>\n    <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> Check regularly whether the webcam image has </span>\n    <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> been updated.
