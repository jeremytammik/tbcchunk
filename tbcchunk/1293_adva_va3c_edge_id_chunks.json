To do so, you set ComputeReferences to true when querying an element for its geometry. </p><p>These references can be converted to a stable string representation for storage and later retrieval using the Reference.ConvertToStableRepresentation method.</p><p>I suggest a much simpler approach here that may be of interest to you,\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/great-ocean-road-and-creating-your-own-key.html#2\">\ncreating your own key based on geometric location</a>.</p><p>That will obviously not be stable either, but it might provide what you need.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n\nUsing Dictionary for assigning unique ids to curve endpoints (XYZ) worked for me.</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>"
