Nice to \"meet\" you. I'm an architect/coder and have worked on many Revit addins these past few years, alongside other stuff like recently building and scaling e-verse (https://e-verse.com/). I wanted to share an article we recently published on our blog to see if it could help the community, shedding some light on the structure we use for Revit addins: https://blog.e-verse.com/build/coding-revit-add-ins-the-e-verse-way. I know you've covered this subject and shared many templates over the years since I've been a reader of The Building Coder for a while now, so I figured maybe we could contribute to that if you find anything you think can add value there. There's more to come as well.

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> BIM 360 Links Not Found Solution\n\nLuiz Henrique [@ricaun](https://github.com/ricaun) Cassettari shared a helpful \n[BIM 360 links not found fix](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bim-360-links-not-found-fix/td-p/11463147):\n\nA user reports to me that some of my plugins had problems with BIM360 links; after testing a lot of things, I found out what is causing the problem. It's a known problem here in the forum. It is caused by referencing a higher version of the `Newtonsoft.Json` package.\n\nIn Revit 2021, the default version of `Newtonsoft.Json` is 11; when an application or plugin requests to load `Newtonsoft.Json` version 13 and it is not found in the plugins folder, something strange happens.\n\nInstead of ignoring and using the already loaded `Newtonsoft.Json` version 11, for some reason, Revit loads a `Newtonsoft.Json` file from the Autodesk `PnIDModeler` add-in, and it is a version 11.\n\nNow, if you have two copies of `Newtonsoft.Json` with the same version loaded in Revit, when BIM360 tries to initialize (usually happens when you open a Revit file that requires BIM360), it will throw an exception in the Journal and the BIM360 service fails. Without the service, Revit can't load BIM360 link. It displays this message:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ricaun_bim360_link_cannot_load.png\" alt=\"Cannot load BIM360 link\" title=\"Cannot load BIM360 link\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 802 x 603 -->\n</center>\n\nA quick fix would be to remove or change the name of the `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` file in the Autodesk `PnIDModeler` add-in.\n\nOr, if you are a developer using an old version like version 9, it should work; Revit will load the default version instead. But if you need to use a specific version of `Newtonsoft.Json`, be aware that it could cause some issues in Revit.\n\nHere is Luiz' seven-minute video explanation \non [how to fix BIM360 link not found problem](https://youtu.be/gNnZZjbBVlU):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gNnZZjbBVlU\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nRelated references:\n\n- [BIM 360 \"Linked document is not found\" error](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bim-360-quot-linked-document-is-not-found-quot-error/m-p/10638072)\n- [BIM 360 Links issue](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bim-360-links-issue/m-p/10536461)\n- [archi+lab DLL Hell is Real](https://archi-lab.net/dll-hell-is-real/)\n- [Newtonsoft Json.dll Version Conflict](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/02/getting-started-once-again.html#6)\n\nMany thanks to Luiz Henrique for documenting and sharing this important solution!"
