That seems a bit messy, though, so I have avoided that so far.</p><p>What is the best practice if you have an existing extensible storage scheme and you want to add more fields to it?\nA far as I can see, it is impossible to change existing schema fields.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, indeed, schema fields cannot be modified, nor can new fields be added.</p><p>Once you publish a schema it is there, immutable, for the rest of the life of the universe.</p><p>If you wish to add new fields or modify existing ones, you have to create a new schema.</p><p>The old one remains untouched.</p><p>You can easily implement an update handler in your add-in that automatically updates all instances of the old schema that it encounters to the new one.</p><p>This is demonstrated by the UpgradeSchema sample provided by my extensible storage\n\n<a href=\"http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&amp;session_id=9263&amp;jid=1725932\">\nclass</a> and\n\n<a href=\"http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&amp;session_id=9726&amp;jid=1725932\">\nlab</a> at\n\nAutodesk University 2011, which include the complete background information on the topic.</p><p>The full\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/melbourne-day-two.html#3\">\nhandouts and sample material</a> are\n\nalso available directly from The Building Coder.</p><p>Some additional topics that we covered since then include:</p><ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/devblog-devcamp-element-and-project-wide-data.html#4\">\nProject wide data storage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/devblog-devcamp-element-and-project-wide-data.html#5\">\nThe DataStorage element</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/05/effortless-extensible-storage.html\">\nExtensible storage extension</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/sydney-revit-api-training-and-vacation.html#8\">\nCustom tagging and extensible storage</a></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Response:</strong> I might change my mind on my current solution unloading and loading Revit links to be able to delete the schema, because it might still not solve problem in all cases.\nFor instance, if users have two Revit projects open and both use the schema, I guess it will not work.
