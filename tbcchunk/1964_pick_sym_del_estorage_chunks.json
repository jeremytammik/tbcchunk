Revit add-in UI design and selection in general in his answer on\nhow to [pick `FamilySymbol` from project browser](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/pick-familysymbol-from-project-browser/td-p/11390552):\n\n**Question:** I want my user to select a FamilySymbol that's already loaded from the UI (more specifically, the Project Browser) that I then further process in my own code.\nI'm aware that there are different methods for filtering the already existing custom families/loading families from file and so on, but is there a way to prompt the user to pick one from the project browser?\nIdeally, it would NOT require the user to make conscious decisions on where to click before starting the add-in.\n\n**Answer:** You could ask users to select an element instance from their view, then get the FamilySymbol from that, but I don't think it's possible from the browser.\n\nIt's not the usual workflow, but now, in Revit 2023, you have the selection changed event which also applies to project browser.\nThis code prompts user to select from browser before adding a selection changed event:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">Public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">Function</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#74531f;\">Obj_220831a</span>(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

results.\n\nNote that not everything in the project browser is a `FamilySymbol`; the parent `ElementType` class will cover more aspects such as system families.\n\nYou would have to continue execution in the handler and perhaps raise an external event to get an editable document status (I suspect the selection changed event doesn't give you that).\n\nYou can also use `e.GetDocument` instead of casting the sender `s` to `UIApplication` to get the `Document`.\n\n**Response:** Thanks for your reply.\nIn your opinion, what would be a workflow that is more common?\n\n**Answer:** It really depends on what your add-in is being used for, i.e., is it modal or modeless interaction?\nIs it working with a few categories of elements or many?\n\nIt is often the case you have to create dialogues that replicate the ones Revit inherently has which is a bit annoying but doesn't take that long with WPF for something such as FamilySymbol selection.\nThat would allow a modal interaction.\n\nYou aim to stay within the `IExternalCommand` context in a modal way to start with, but if that isn't possible, then you have to get back into a similar context via raising an `ExternalEvent` from modeless forms etc.\nThere are also other methods of obtaining a valid context to work with.\n\n**Response:** Thanks for the answer!\n\nDo you happen to have any pointers or examples of how to develop modeless forms with the Revit API by chance?\nWould be much appreciated, thanks!\n\n**Answer:** There are samples in the SDK:\n\n- ...\\Samples\\ModelessDialog\\ModelessForm_ExternalEvent\n\nIt is for Windows Forms, but same approach would be used for WPF.\n\nMany thanks to Richard for the important fundamental advice."

Don't make excuses or talk about the past.\n  Actually, don't talk at all.\n  Soak up, with self-confidence and humility, what the person is saying and take time before responding.\n  When they're finished, you can say, \"Good point\" if you agree ... or, \"I hear you\" if you want to think more about it.\n  Or just: \"Thank you.\"\n- Assume positive intent.\n  The selfish approach for the other person would be to suppress what they really think.\n  If someone has the guts to be frank with you, embrace it and thank them.\n  When Mike asks for critiques from people, he says: \"I promise to take it in the spirit it's intended.\"\n- Don't be defensive.\n  That's the worst response to helpful feedback.\n  It makes the person giving it feel unheard &ndash; and less likely to shoot straight with you in the future.\n- Ask for it.\n  You're more likely to get feedback if you ask peers or superiors &ndash; in a sincere, humble, open-minded way &ndash; how you could be more effective.\n  That projects strength, not weakness.\n- Act on it.\n  If you show you're responsive, you'll get more input.\n  And you'll get better at life and on the job.\n\nCase in point: Often when you're giving a face-to-face review, people will validate and vindicate areas of weakness in the written eval.\n\n- \"Jim doesn't listen\" or \"Jim makes too many excuses\" or \"Jim doesn’t welcome constructive criticism.\"\n- If I then start excuse-peddling or butt-covering, I've kind of made their point.\n\nThe bottom line: Life is about forward motion. Elicit and take feedback to make your personal and professional performance tomorrow better than today."
