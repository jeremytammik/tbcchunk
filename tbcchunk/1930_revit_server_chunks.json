after reading these articles, I still have a question: after getting the Revit Server file path, how do I open the file by Revit API?\n\n**Answer:** I created several add-ins to manage Revit Server files.\nOne of them is to batch export Navisworks files from the Revit Server and the other one for exporting Revit files.\n\nI didn't use the Revit Server API.\nYou can use normal Revit and Windows methods to manage the paths and open the files.\n\nYou can access the Revit Server project through Windows File Explorer.\nIf you don't know the path, ask your IT department.\nYou will probably need permission to access these folders.\n\nIn this image, you can see what it looks like (blurred bits for confidentiality):\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_server_projects.png\" alt=\"Revit Server projects\" title=\"Revit Server projects\" width=\"451\"/> <!-- 902 -->\n</center>\n\nNote that each Revit file is represented by a folder, which ends in \".rvt\"!\nThis is not the actual `rvt` file.\nHowever, if you get the path of one of these folders, you can use it to open the model.\n\n**Response:** I read all the Revit Server articles above and I have a general understanding of how Revit Server works.\nAs described above, I can get the Revit Server `RVT` file through Windows File Explorer.\nFor example, on a Revit Server \"172.18.1.32\", save a central file at \"testfolder\\1.rvt\".\nNow I can open the file in two ways; first:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  doc.OpenFile( @\"RSN://172.18.1.32/testfolder/1.rvt\" )\n</pre>\n\nSecond:\n\n- Use the method `Application.CopyModel`\n- Copy the file as a local file\n- Open the local file\n\nAfter modifying the file, I want to synchronise with the central file.\n\nWill I get a different result depending on which of the two way used to open the file?\n\n<!---\n\n**Answer:** Can you try it out and let us know how it works for you?\n\n**Response:** When I enter the file path like this in the Revit open file dialogue: *\"RSN://172.18.1.32/8364dfab-968d-4a9c-8b6b-f75d0c1b5330/04_二次沉淀池_结构.rvt\"*, \nit is opened successfully.\nWhen I try to open it using *Application.OpenDocumentFile( @\"RSN://172.18.1.32/8364dfab-968d-4a9c-8b6b-f75d0c1b5330/04_二次沉淀池_结构.rvt\")*,\nhowever, it fails; Revit returns the error message \"the filepath to be opened doesn't exist\",the method  Application.CopyModel(),return the same message.\n\nNow I'm very confused; can you provide an example about open revit server file?\n\n--->\n\n**Response:** I copy the folder from Revit Server to local, but I don't know how to open the `.rvt` project though the folder and sub file:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_server_projects_2.png\" alt=\"Revit Server projects\" title=\"Revit Server projects\" width=\"495\"/> <!-- 991 -->\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** In Revit, you need to open the highlighted folder:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_server_projects_3.png\" alt=\"Revit Server projects\" title=\"Revit Server projects\" width=\"278\"/> <!-- 476 -->\n</center>\n\nYou need to pass Revit the path to that folder, not to what is inside!\n\nSo, for example, assume you have the path *Autodesk/Revit Server 2021/Projects/FOLDER.rvt*.\n\nJust pass that path to the Revit API. I know it is weird, because it is a folder and not a Revit file!!\n\nBut this is how it works.\n\nAlso, you will need to transform the path to a Revit Server path.\n\nSo, given this path:\n\n- *\\\\revit-london\\Autodesk$\\Revit Server 2021\\Projects\\2054 SingleHouseProject\\Model1.rvt*\n\nI need to transform it to:\n\n- *RSN://REVIT-LONDON.zzz.s/Autodesk$/Revit Server 2021/Projects/2054 SingleHouseProject/Model1.rvt*\n\nNote that I also changed slash `/` to backslash `\\`.\n\nMany thanks to Hernan for his experience and friendly guidance!"
