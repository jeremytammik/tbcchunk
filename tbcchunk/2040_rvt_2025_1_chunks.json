The approach would typically be:\n\n- [change active view](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/b6adb74b-39af-9213-c37b-f54db76b75a3.htm)\n- [call PlaceGroup()](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2019/586d4f2e-0985-2d0b-dbb7-ea6d2f704336.htm)\n\nHowever, in Design Automation, I don't have access to the UI and therefore cannot set `UIDocument.Activeview`.\nIs there an alternative method for placing detail groups which takes in a `View` as an argument?\nOr are there ways to change the `ActiveView` in Design Automation?\n\nRicaun provided non-UI-dependent code that places both model and detail groups.\nIt just lacks the possibility to control the target view.\n\nHowever, this can be worked around by letting Revit place the detail group in any old view,\nthen copy and paste to the desired target view and delete the intermediate element.\n\nHere is a 30-minute video testing [placement of a detail group in both Revit on the Windows desktop and Revit for Design Automation](https://youtu.be/oSCvXGx4SaM):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oSCvXGx4SaM?si=MU_SFS--lr4zLW15\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nGoing even further, ricaun\nimplemented [`RevitTestPlaceGroup.Tests`, a unit test project for the PlaceGroup problem](https://github.com/ricaun-io/RevitTestPlaceGroup.Tests) and\nshows it running in another 36-minute video\non [creating `PlaceGroupDetail` unit test for Revit API](https://youtu.be/VhaFv_UaHGU):\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhaFv_UaHGU?si=Gj1VWrgOh3ajtSsa\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nEver so many thanks to ricaun for the very helpful work and excellent documentation!"
