    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>Threats to our Freedom in the Digital Society\n\nParticipation in a digital society can be good or bad.\nIt depends: is the society just or unjust?\nIf unjust, extract yourself.\n\nThreats arise from software that the user does not control, i.e. is not free.\n\nFree means 'supporting the freedom of the user, not free of cost.\n\nIn French, 'libre' versus 'gratuit'.\n\nPayment is a minor detail.\nEither way is fine.\nThe issue is not how you obtain the software, but what you get.\n\nDoes your software preserve and support your freedom, or attack it?\n\nDoes the user control the program?\n\nOr does the program control the user?\n\nOur goal is for you to retain control over your life and activities.\n\nFree software must satisfy the following basic criteria:\n\n- Freedom to run the program.\n- Freedom to study and modify the program, i.e., access to source code.\n- Collective control, enabling users to participate in and affect the development, either as programmers or just with ideas, needs and wishes.\n- Redistribution rights, including optional modifications, for free or for a charge.\n\nProprietary software is a scheme to enslave people.\n\nActually, it's worse... that is what it was like 30 years ago.\n\nNowadays, the proprietary owners are fully aware of their power and are willing to use this power to hurt their users.\n\nNon-free software is often malware, intentionally designed to hurt the user, e.g., spy on him or her.\n\nComputer systems and most portable phones are equipped with a universal backdoor that enables them to be accessed, manipulated and exploited without the user's consent or knowledge.\n\n[gnu.org/proprietary](http://www.gnu.org/proprietary) provides a list of other proprietary malware.\n\nThe only known defence against proprietary malware is free software."
