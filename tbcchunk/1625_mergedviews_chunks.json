Two DWGs showing the views exactly as they appear on the sheet and another DWG representing the sheet. This DWG contains two Xrefs that point to the views.\n\nWhen `MergedViews` is true and we export the sheet, the result is only one file. The generated model contains both views (not as Xref).\n \nSo, if you want to export multiple views in the same DWG file, you should create a sheet, place all desired views on it, and export the sheet. If you want to export them as Xref files you should use set `MergedView` to false, otherwise you should set it to true.\n \nHere is a picture showing where the `MergedViews` option is presented in the UI:\n \n<center>\n<img src=\"img/sd_merged_views.png\" alt=\"MergedViews in the UI\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n\nAnother option may be to export individual DWGs using the Revit API and follow up with the AutoCAD I/O API &ndash; using either standalone AcCoreConsole, or, in the cloud, the Forge AutoCAD Design Automation API &ndash; to import all the created DWGs as `BlockReference` entities (and create `BlockRefInstance` entities too, if required) into a master DWG.\n\nThank you very much, Stefan and Miro, for the illuminating advice."
