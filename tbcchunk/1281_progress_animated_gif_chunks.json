But the workaround uses a modeless form, that means user still can make changes through the Revit UI while the .NET API is called – isn't that less protected?</p><p>My project is in fact not multi-threaded, it just uses one single thread with Revit running in the background while a modal Windows form updates the status in the front.\nI'm surprised that it causes Revit 2015 to crash and works fine in previous versions.</p><p>In the end, I figured out a workaround to solve the problem.</p><p>Here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/lotusinriver/MonitorProgressRevit\">source code</a> that I uploaded to\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/lotusinriver/MonitorProgressRevit\">update a progress bar from a modal dialogue while calling the Revit API</a>.</p><p>I hope it helps others using a similar approach to implement this feature as well.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n\nYour solution caused me some confusion...</p><p>For instance, you do not provide an add-in manifest, so I had to write it myself.</p><p>The solution name is MonitorProgressRevit, the project name is MonitorProgress.vbproj, and the resulting .NET assembly DLL is MonitorProgess.dll, with one 'r' missing.</p><p>It took a few attempts and some time experimenting to figure all this out...</p><p>Still working on it, though...</p><p>In the end, I got it compiled and tested successfully on Revit 2015.</p><p>I created a pull request to update your repository with my changes.</p><p>Can you pull it, please?</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n\nI merged <a href=\"https://github.com/lotusinriver/MonitorProgressRevit/pull/1\">your pull request</a> and\n\nmade you a project collaborator.</p><p>Regarding the description of this repository, I think your blog provides more detailed information about this issue.\nThe repository readme includes the link of your blog, so the user should be able to get it.</p><p>The purpose of my project is to provide a modal dialog with status update when running the Revit API (e.g., to update an element instance parameter), and also the user can cancel the action at any time during the process.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n\nHere is a 59-second video demonstrating Limin's add-in modifying a Revit element parameter value and displaying the on-going progress in a live progress bar:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"MonitorProgress 3\" src=\"img/monitor_progress_442_3.gif\" width=\"442\"/>\n</center><p>(Actually, this is not the first 77 MB animated GIF that I produced, but the final optimised 3 MB version discussed below).</p><a name=\"2\"></a>"

On Windows, Camtasia can generate animated GIF files, but alas, the Mac version lacks this feature.</p><p>So I went ahead and set up a Unix based command line tool or two to create one myself.</p><p>As far as I can tell, the simplest way to achieve this is to use ffmpeg and gifsicle as described by Sharad Chhetri in\n\n<a href=\"http://sharadchhetri.com/2013/07/10/convert-video-file-into-gif-file-through-command-line-in-linux\">\nconverting a video file into GIF on the Linux command line</a>.</p><p>I performed the following steps:</p><p><strong>1.</strong>\n\nI compiled and installed gifsicle from the tar.gz package provided by the\n\n<a href=\"http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle\">\nGifsicle page on lcdf.org</a>.</p><p><strong>2.</strong>\n\nI used the build and installation instructions from the\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle\">\nGifsicle GitHub repository</a> to\n\ncreate my binary Mac OS executable.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>\n\nI cloned the <a href=\"https://github.com/lotusinriver/MonitorProgressRevit\">MonitorProgress GitHub project</a>,\ncompiled and installed it, started Revit and set up a very small Revit window width of only 884 pixels.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> I recorded an MP4 file using Camtasia for Mac, generating the file monitor_progress.mp4, 13831227 bytes in size.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> I converted the MP4 file to 596 individual GIF images using ffmpeg:</p><pre>\n$ ffmpeg -i monitor_progress.mp4 -r 10 output/out%04d.gif\n\n$ ls -o output/\ntotal 153416\n  161986  out0001.gif\n  162589  out0002.gif\n  162555  out0003.gif\n. . .\n  128736  out0594.gif\n  128649  out0595.gif\n  129043  out0596.gif\n</pre><p>The contents of the output folder are ca. 77 MB in size.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> I used gifsicle to create a looping animated gif:</p><pre>\n$ gifsicle -d 10 -l  output/*.gif &gt; monitor_progress.gif\n</pre><p>The result is one single GIF file, monitor_progress.gif, still 76869920 bytes in size.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> You can display it in the web browser using the following minimal HTML wrapper monitor_progress.html:</p><pre>\n<span class=\"blue\">  &lt;</span><span class=\"maroon\">html</span><span class=\"blue\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"blue\">    &lt;</span><span class=\"maroon\">body</span><span class=\"blue\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"blue\">      &lt;</span><span class=\"maroon\">img</span><span class=\"blue\"> </span><span class=\"red\">src</span><span class=\"blue\">=</span>\"<span class=\"blue\">monitor_progress.gif</span>\"<span class=\"blue\"> </span><span class=\"red\">width</span><span class=\"blue\">=</span>\"<span class=\"blue\">442</span>\"<span class=\"blue\">/&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"blue\">    &lt;/</span><span class=\"maroon\">body</span><span class=\"blue\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"blue\">  &lt;/</span><span class=\"maroon\">html</span><span class=\"blue\">&gt;</span>\n</pre><p>This displays the same result in the browser as the animated image above.</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
