You can now access the detailed geometry of the elements that form the boundary of the rooms. Until now we were only able to read the general shape of the room  now we can associate that shape with the elements that form the boundary. One of the existing samples, RoofsRooms, which used 300 lines of code to find out if the top boundary of the room intersected the roof or not, has now reduced to 30-40 lines of code.\n<li>Detailed energy analysis: obtain and analyze the contents of a project's detailed energy model, as seen in the Export to gbXML and the Heating and Cooling Loads features; produce an analytical thermal model from the physical model of a building composed of spaces, zones and planar surfaces that represent the actual volumetric elements of the building.\n<li>Conceptual energy analysis: provide access to the elements and objects created by Revit to perform energy analysis on conceptual design models.\n<li>Analysis Visualization Framework enhancements: support multiple analysis results in the same view, store persistent meta data.\n<li>MEP API enhancements\n<ul>\n<li>Placeholder ducts and pipes: Identify, create, and convert placeholders to physical elements\n<li>PipeSettings, PipeSizeSettings: Read and write access to the plumbing settings governing pipe sizes in Revit MEP\n<li>DuctInsulation, PipeInsulation, DuctLining: Read, write and create access to new procedural insulation and lining features\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<li>Rebar enhancements: multi-planar 3D rebars, corbels.\n<li>Construction modelling: access to parts and assemblies, shop drawings, isolate groups of elements.\n<li>Point Clouds: Engine API for point cloud generation, Client API for point cloud consumption.\n<li>Extensible Storage: read and assign application-owned data to specific elements, create custom XML-based schemas for data storage.\n<li>Linked Models: find external file references, trace the file path of external files and understand the load state in a Revit session, identify if a file is imported or merely linked, what kinds of link, what path.\n<li>Performance Advisor API: issue warnings for elements or settings that may cause performance degradation or affect model performance\n, \naccess built-in Revit rules, define, add and remove custom rules, execute any combination of rules.\n<li>And More:\n<ul>\n<li>Adaptive Components\n<li>IFC Document Open\n<li>FamilyParameter.GUID property: identify shared parameters.\n<li>Copy Element: copy and translate (copy + move).\n<li>Workplane Flip for Family Instances: face-hosted family manipulation.\n<li>Disallow Wall End Joins\n<li>Write access to Element Pinned\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>Sound exciting?\n\n<p>I promise you, it is!\n</p></p></p>"
