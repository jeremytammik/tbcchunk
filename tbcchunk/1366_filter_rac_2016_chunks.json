    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Simple Filtered Element Collector Samples\n\n**Question:**\nI am trying to write C# code to use the Revit API.\n\nThe nice samples in the SDK are rather complex :-)\n\nA simple thing I think would be a help for many is some simple samples, e.g.:\n\n- How to make a filtered element collector with a type and an instance parameter for the different categories? Maybe how to write to them as well?\n- How to make a filter for system families such as walls, floors, ceilings, to get one type and one instance parameter. This could be one single sample, if the method can be used for several categories.\n- Host sweeps\n- Ramps and stairs\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"green\">// Floors, Walls, Ceilings, Roofs etc...</span>\n&nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">FilteredElementCollector</span> FMFloorCollector\n&nbsp; &nbsp; = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">FilteredElementCollector</span>( doc );\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; FMFloorCollector.OfClass( <span class=\"blue\">typeof</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Floor</span> ) );\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Floor</span> FMFloor <span class=\"blue\">in</span> FMFloorCollector )\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"green\">// Type</span>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Element</span> el = FMFloor <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Element</span>;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">ElementId</span> typeid = el.GetTypeId();\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Element</span> floortype = doc.GetElement( typeid );\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Parameter</span> pKeynote = floortype.get_Parameter(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">BuiltInParameter</span>.KEYNOTE_PARAM );\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"green\">// Instance</span>\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">Parameter</span> pArea = FMFloor.get_Parameter(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"teal\">BuiltInParameter</span>.HOST_AREA_COMPUTED );\n&nbsp; }\n</pre>\n\nWhat people want to do with the data forms and so on is more or less standard C#.\n\nBut simply how to set/get could be nice...\n\n**Answer:**\nHave you looked at [The Building Coder](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples) samples?\n\nEspecially,\nthe [CmdCollectorPerformance module](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdCollectorPerformance.cs) provides\na large number of such samples and probably covers all of the examples you list.\n\nPlease let me know if anything is missing.\n\nOr, better still, fork the repository, add them yourself, and let me know so I can merge your update back in again.\n\nThank you!"
