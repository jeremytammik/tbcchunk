We’re now entering a new age of opportunity for builders, designers and engineers. The power of the cloud + Big Data means we can connect people, processes, ideas, and things like never before. As physical and digital technology come together to create endless possibilities for designing, building, and operating buildings and infrastructure, it’s never been so important to embrace BIM. To help you harness the opportunities, Autodesk is connecting to the future with tightly connected BIM tools and processes for the lifecycle for buildings and infrastructure. This is the future of making things.\n\n- [Connecting teams](http://eraofconnection.com/connecting-teams): In the era of connection, we’re transitioning from applications and files to putting the project at the centre from the start. Using the cloud to connect data and systems, projects and teams are always up to date &ndash; in the office and on the job site &ndash; sharing information and collaborating across the project lifecycle in real time, without barriers.\n- [Connecting insight](http://eraofconnection.com/connecting-insight): Connected technology puts 'big data' to work to help deliver better designs and more predictable performance. Beginning with conceptual design through project delivery and asset management, project teams will be able to tap into huge amounts of data to put their ideas into context and deliver 'best possible' building and infrastructure performance.\n- [Connecting outcomes](http://eraofconnection.com/connecting-outcomes): Start with your desired outcome, then explore a near infinite range of possibilities and produce optimal designs in a fraction of the time &ndash; the power of the cloud helps make this a reality today. Designers and engineers can generate multiple options, ideas and scenarios more rapidly than ever before &ndash; exploring forms, simulating performance, and impressing clients with cinematic quality renders and optimal designs.\n- [Connecting delivery](http://eraofconnection.com/connecting-delivery): As the lines between digital processing and physical systems blur, the design and build phases of projects are moving closer together. Seamless integration of these processes using pre-fabrication, modular construction and 3D printing saves time and money.\n\n<center>\n[<span style=\"font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold\">eraofconnection.com</span>](http://eraofconnection.com)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</center>"
