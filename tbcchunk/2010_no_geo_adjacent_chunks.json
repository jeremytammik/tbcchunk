At the moment I can get part of the references based on the Wall geometry. I first go to the Solids and for each edge of the solid I check if the Reference is of type CUT_EDGE. This works but does not get all the options (I see more when generating a dimension line manually in the UI of Revit).\n\nFor example, I have the wall seen in this image:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/cut_edge_voodoo_2.png\" alt=\"CUT_EDGE reference stable representation\" title=\"CUT_EDGE reference stable representation\" width=\"500\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 786 Pixel Width: 1,120 -->\n</center>\n\nThe dimension is attached to the following `CUT_EDGE` references:\n\n- 3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/0/1\n- 3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/1/1\n\nBut when I run over all the edges of the wall, I only get the following options:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/cut_edge_voodoo_1.png\" alt=\"CUT_EDGE reference stable representation\" title=\"CUT_EDGE reference stable representation\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 253\nPixel Width: 514 -->\n</center>\n\nI tested setting visibility options, detail options, and `IncludeNonVisibleObjects`, but nothing helps.\n\nI think knowing better what the structure of the stable representations mean could help a lot.\n\n**Answer:** Here is my finding that actually worked, for example using the Stable Representation *3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/0/1*.\n\n- 3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f: Refers to the element itself\n- 8: Is the ID of the face of the Revit `Element`\n- CUT_EDGE/0/1: This is the type and location of the Reference. It is CUT_EDGE type,  the `1` means which edge of the face, and the `0` is its end-point index.\n\nMy original findings were correct; I was just missing the index of the end-point of the edge I found. All this is possible to find via the Edges of the Solids that are part of the geometry of an Element.\n\nMany thanks to Joseph for his research and clear explanation!\n\nIt provides a welcome addition to The Building Coder collection of stable representation magic voodoo information:\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/stable-reference-string-magic-voodoo.html\">Reference Stable Representation Magic Voodoo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/08/voodoo-magic-retrieves-global-instance-edges.html\">Voodoo Magic Retrieves Global Instance Edges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/hatch-line-dimensioning-voodoo.html\">Hatch Line Dimensioning Voodoo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/picked-family-instance-face-geometry-in-lcs-versus-wcs.html\">Picked Instance Face Geometry in LCS Versus WCS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/reference-intersector-and-deleting-reference-planes.html#5\">Reformat Stable Representation String for Dimensioning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/02/stable-reference-relationships.html\">Stable Reference Relationships</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/03/ifc-dimension-and-reference-intersector-with-links.html#4\">Stable Representation Voodoo for Reference Intersector with Links</a></li>\n</ul>"
