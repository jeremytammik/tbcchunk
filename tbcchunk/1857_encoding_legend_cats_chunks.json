[jjesusdelpino](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3486289) Del Pino Campos\ncollaborated nicely to determine\nwhich [categories that can create legend components](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/categories-that-can-create-legend-components/m-p/9659069):\n\n**Question:** Is there a way to know if a legend component can be created from a determined category?\nE.g., I can create legend components from cable trays, but I can't do it with railings.\nI haven't seen any specific rule o parameter that specifies this property.\nAny ideas?\nThanks.\n\n**Answer:** I've found no obvious solution to this via the API, i.e., a Boolean property on the category class.\n\nI believe also that Legend views don't have a specific class.\n\nSo, there is no static methods available on such for checking category suitability of placed elements that way either.\n\nYou'll find sketch based system families (floors/Railings/Stairs...) are not applicable since Legend views don't have a sketch plane.\n\nIf you think about it, apart from annotation objects, Legend views contain types not instances (since you usually drag the types onto the Legend from the project browser).\n\nHowever, there is also no property for this indicated on `ElementType` class.\n\n**Response:** I also have not found any solution for this through API, so I have ended up checking and making the list manually.\n\nI put it here in case someone looking for the same thing comes:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\nFamilyInstances = [“OST_DuctAccessory”, “OST_PipeAccessory”, “OST_PlumbingFixtures”, “OST_StructuralFraming”, “OST_StructuralFoundation”, “OST_ElectricalEquipment”, “OST_SpecialityEquipment”, “OST_MechanicalEquipment”, “OST_LightingFixtures”, “OST_Furniture”, “OST_Casework”, “OST_Columns”, “OST_StructuralColumns”, ”OST_Doors”, ”OST_Sprinklers”, “OST_DuctTerminal”, “OST_DuctFitting”, “OST_PipeFitting”, “OST_Planting”, “OST_Windows”];\n\nSystemFamilies = [“OST_CableTray”, ”OST_RoofSoffit”, “OST_Ceilings”, “OST_DuctCurves”, “OST_Roofs”, “OST_Walls”, “OST_StackedWalls”, ”OST_CurtainWallPanels”, “OST_Floors”, ”OST_PipeCurves”, ”OST_FlexPipeCurves”,” OST_Conduit”];\n</pre>\n\nMany thanks to Juan Jesús and Richard for sharing this result.\n\nI cleaned it up and added it\nto [The Building Coder

Revit is not a full blown text processor, so it relies on the presence of that BOM to properly handle files.\nWithout it, Revit assume they are 'normal' ANSI encoded files and thus will not process them correctly.\n\nCorrection after another, deeper, look at the code prior to this fix, in older versions of Revit:\nUnfortunately, upon further investigation, that code assumes the file is a set of single byte characters to load.\nNot even a proper ANSI code page encoding is being applied, although the workarounds look like that is possibly going on as part of the internal file read…\nAnyway, I do not think using any sort of Unicode encoding on the files in question for previous versions of Revit will work after all.\nIt does in the current version, though.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/cyrillic_characters.png\" alt=\"Cyrillic characters\" title=\"Cyrillic characters\" width=\"316\"/>\n</center>"
