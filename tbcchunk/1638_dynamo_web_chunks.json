The opportunity is to take your Dynamo projects and make them available to a much wider audience &ndash; across the company, to business partners, or even as a commercial app &ndash; through a tailored web page (or desktop or mobile app) you create.\n\nWe are considering three possible implementations of Dynamo on the Cloud, and would like to know which of them most interests you, why, and how you envision using it:\n\n1. [Dynamo as part of Forge Design Automation for Revit](#3.1)\n2. [Headless Dynamo](#3.2)\n3. [Full Dynamo on the Web](#3.3)\n\n####<a name=\"3.1\"></a>1. Dynamo as part of Forge Design Automation for Revit\n\nAs you may have heard already, Autodesk is well down the path\ndeveloping [Forge Design Automation for Revit](http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/classes/year-2017/autocad/sd124720#chapter=0),\naka [Revit I/O](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28b).\n\nThis is Revit as an 'engine' on the cloud.  No user interface, aka 'headless' &ndash; an engine you can drive using the Revit API we have today.  We are currently working on moving Forge Design Automation for Revit from private to public beta.\n\nWould you like to be able to leverage Dynamo too?  No user interface means you would be programmatically loading a Revit app and your Dynamo project into a Revit instance on the cloud, pushing parameters and getting results &ndash; with your own handling of all user interaction (and maybe even server to server?).\n\n####<a name=\"3.2\"></a>2. Headless Dynamo\n\nDynamo as a standalone 'headless' engine on the cloud to orchestrate between services.\n\nDynamo is architected to not just drive Revit, but to power computational design processes that span any number of design tools and web services.  Do you have an application for Dynamo as a computational design engine independent of Revit? Again, this is a 'no UI' Dynamo web service &ndash; you would be responsible for creating and delivering the UI.\n\nThe Dynamo team has been building a new computational system that is cloud-native and completely independent from desktop applications. Do you have a set of Forge services you would like to tie together but are not sure how? You can use this to connect to existing Forge services and orchestrate how data flows between your application and services. You can use it as a way to extract logic and features from your desktop applications and re-use them as microservices in the cloud.\n\n####<a name=\"3.3\"></a>3. Full Dynamo on the Web\n\nDynamo on the Web &ndash; with full user interface as Dynamo Studio users experience today.\n\nYou have used Dynamo Studio along with Revit.  Do you have a problem that would be best solved by including Dynamo Studio (as a web service) inside your application of choice?  This would likely enable you to embed the complete Dynamo Studio UI in a web page, desktop or mobile app of your making.\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>Your Choice\n\nOver the last few years Autodesk has invested time replumbing Dynamo to make all three of these Dynamo on the Cloud implementations a real possibility.  Now we need to hear which (if any) of these Dynamo on the Cloud you want and why.  Based on your input, both what you want to create and how many Autodesk customers and partners are also interested in these various Dynamo on the Cloud implementations, we’ll decide on how to best move forward delivering Dynamo as a Forge Computational Design API.\n\nPlease don’t hold back.  We need to hear from you.  If we don’t hear enough interest from the Dynamo and Forge development community, we might just leave Dynamo on the Cloud on the back shelf for another day.\n\nHow to let us know what you want? Just send an email\nto [jim.quanci@autodesk.com](mailto:jim.quanci@autodesk.com) to\nparticipate in Dynamo as a Service research and discussion, and let him know:\n\n- Which of the three above potential implementations you are interested in\n- Why\n- A few sentences of about your 'vision' of the user experience/app you would like to create\n- The company you work for\n- Your depth of experience with Dynamo today (beginner, advanced, 'guru')\n- Your telephone number, so we can talk live if we want to explore and better understand your potential application of Dynamo on the Cloud\n\nThank you!"
