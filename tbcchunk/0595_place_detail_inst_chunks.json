I'm rather new to the Revit API and might be missing something obvious.\n\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> While creating a test case I think I solved the problem.\n\n<p>I found a new overload of the NewFamilyInstance method in Revit 2012 that takes Line, FamilySymbol and View input arguments.\nThis seems to work for my line based detail item.\nUsing the override with a point as the first parameter only works with point based detail items.\n\n<p>Many thanks to Frode for this discovery!\n\n<p>That leads me to look in more detail at the new overloads of the NewFamilyInstance method.\n\n\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n<h4>New overloads of the NewFamilyInstance method in the Revit 2012 API</h4>\n<p>The nine overloads of the NewFamilyInstance method provided by the Revit 2011 API take the following lists of input arguments:\n\n<ul>\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, View\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Element, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Element, Level, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, XYZ, Element, StructuralType\n<li>Curve, FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType\n<li>Face, XYZ, XYZ, FamilySymbol\n<li>Face, Line, FamilySymbol\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>The Revit 2012 API provides twelve overloads:\n\n<ul>\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, View\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Element, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, Element, Level, StructuralType\n<li>XYZ, FamilySymbol, XYZ, Element, StructuralType\n<li>Curve, FamilySymbol, Level, StructuralType\n<li>Face, XYZ, XYZ, FamilySymbol\n<li>Face, Line, FamilySymbol\n<li>Line, FamilySymbol, View\n<li>Reference, XYZ, XYZ, FamilySymbol\n<li>Reference, Line, FamilySymbol\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>The three last ones are new, respectively intended for:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a line based detail family instance into the Revit document, using a line and a view where the instance should be placed.\n<li>Inserting a new instance of a family onto a face referenced by the input Reference instance, using a location, reference direction, and a type/symbol.\n<li>Inserting a new instance of a family onto a face referenced by the input Reference instance, using a line on that face for its position, and a type/symbol.\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>As the issues arising in this area indicate, the topic of adding a new family instance can be complex and sometimes requires a bit of research to find the right approach in each case.\nI hope this helps a little.\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
