Regarding the two 'cart' files:</p><p>It should be possible to handle that error more gracefully.</p><p>I took a look at the new sample files and see the cause of it now.</p><p>Again, it has to do with the OBJ file format, how it is populated, and our lack of understanding of it.</p><p>If you look at the code, the current implementation grabs all the faces from this loop:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Face</span> f <span class=\"blue\">in</span> obj_load_result.Model.UngroupedFaces )\n</pre><p>This provides a sensible result in the cart-exported file, which I successfully imported into Revit like this:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Shopping cart ungrouped\" src=\"img/directobjloader_shopping_cart.png\" width=\"260\"/>\n</center><p>The problem with the 'unexported' file is not memory.</p><p>It has a higher intelligence, that is all.</p><p>In the 'unexported' file, the result.Model.UngroupedFaces collection is empty.</p><p>Instead, the OBJ model defines 17 named OBJ groups:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"DirectObjLoader groups\" src=\"img/directobjloader_groups.png\" width=\"256\"/>\n</center><p>This is presumably much better, because the groups carry information and structure, whereas ungrouped faces do not.</p><p>So your 'export' procedure is probably destroying model structure and valuable information.</p><p>The  importer is currently ignoring groups, however.</p><p>I added an error message on zero faces in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.4\">version 2015.0.0.4</a>,\n\nso you have a more graceful exit, at least.</p><p>I also added a first stab at support for groups in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.5\">version 2015.0.0.5</a>.</p><p>The result for the 'unexported' shopping cart is not good yet, though.</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-11 -->\n\nI think it's acceptable to have an error/fail dialog when there is something too complicated in the file for importing. Running the OBJ through Memento to decimate it may often be a good thing.</p><p>Looks like the OBJ format can get very sophisticated:\n\n<a href=\"http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj\">paulbourke.net/dataformats/obj</a>.</p><p>Under the heading Grouping, he explains the syntax and gives several examples of Group usage.</p><p>Yesterday, I tried to use <a href=\"http://meshlab.sourceforge.net\">Meshlab</a> to convert a point cloud to a mesh.

Someday...</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-11 -->\n\nI found one improvement, closing the face set off for each OBJ group, and implemented that in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.6\">version 2015.0.0.6</a>.</p>\n<p>The result with that enhancement is still not perfect, though.\nIt looks like this:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Shopping cart groups 2\" src=\"img/directobjloader_shopping_cart_groups_2.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Some progress at least.</p>\n<p>I also uploaded the <a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/StlImport\">STL importer</a> to GitHub.</p>\n<p>It includes two sample files to load.</p>\n<p>Even more to play with!</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-12 -->\n\nExcellent. (I think I saw that cart in back of the Market Basket on the train tracks.)</p>\n<p>I was thinking, What if there was a separate shape element created for each Group if there are any extant?\nHence, a loop the same as the main mesh for each Group.\nDo you think that would work?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-12 -->\n\nIndeed excellent.</p>\n<p>When you put on your thinking cap, you deliver.</p>\n<p>This is the result of loading the shopping cart and closing off each OBJ group into an own separate DirectShape element:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Shopping cart groups 3\" src=\"img/directobjloader_shopping_cart_groups_3.png\" width=\"308\"/>\n</center>\n<p>So it looks like we are done with this for the moment, with\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.7\">version 2015.0.0.7</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-12 -->\n\nSplendid work, Jeremy.\nYou have gone from Cubism to Realism in your artistic style.</p>\n<p>After 14 years, OBJ can be imported to Revit.</p>\n<p>May the thinking cap will remain on...</p>\n<!-- <p><strong>Response:</strong> -->\n<!-- 2014-12-19 -->\n<p>I was working on a facade model for a client yesterday. The client does not want to pay for laser scanning, yet. We went out and took 50 pictures, then uploaded to Recap360 and turned the photos into a mesh.

I'm sure the IFC importer does that somewhere but the code is too complicated for me.</p>\n<a name=\"6\"></a>\n<h4>Smoothing</h4>\n<p>A problem with the importer as you wrote it is that the smoothing or 's' data in the OBJ are not used or used correctly.  See attached 'sandal.obj'. When I process an OBJ through Mesh Lab or Memento, the 's' data get converted to faces. That is an adequate workaround at this time. My challenge this week is to get the app published without too much feature creep.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI fixed the OBJ loader to support faces with more than four vertices in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.9\">version 2015.0.0.9</a>.</p>\n<p>This enables partial loading of the sandal.obj sample file, but with some holes, similar to the untreated Cessna:</p>\n<!--\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/sandal_with_gaps.png\" alt=\"Sandal with gaps in Revit\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n-->\n<p>You want to watch out with your Memento clean-up... it destroys the OBJ groups and thus looses important model structure information.</p>\n<p>Here is the complete Cessna cleaned up by Memento:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Cessna exported from Memento\" src=\"img/cessna-exported-from-Memento.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Here is the original one with model structure but lacking some faces:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Cessna with groups and missing faces\" src=\"img/cessna_with_groups_and_missing_faces.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>I switched TessellatedShapeBuilder target from Mesh to AnyGeometry as well, and it does indeed look a bit better.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI think AnyGeometry attempts to make a solid.\nIf a solid is made, dimensions can work on it.</p>\n<p>The bigger issue is the smoothing data that are not processed in the original OBJ. I am okay with it for now. From searching around it looks like many apps don't handle smoothing with OBJs. Paraphrasing the founder of LinkedIn: \"If you are not embarrassed by the first release of your product, you worked on it too long\".</p>\n<p>Attached is another difficult OBJ. Running it though MeshLab and turning it to triangles fixes it, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nI do not believe the tessellated face builder supports smoothing.</p>\n<p>The inverse operation, using the custom exporter to generate an OBJ output, would happily support this, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nThere must be a way to handle the smoothing stuff, and just make facets, since MeshLab and Memento do it.\nI just don't know how to do it.</p>\n<p>This\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/utils/converters/obj/convert_obj_three.py\">convert_obj_three.py</a> Python\n\ncode from three.js seems to handle smoothing in OBJ.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nAs already said, the DirectShape generator provided by the Revit API does not support smoothing.</p>\n<p>It is pure geometry.</p>\n<p>Smoothing is pure rendering.</p>\n<p>No connection, no workaround.</p>\n<p>Forget it.</p>\n<a name=\"7\"></a>\n<h4>Pyramid Problem – OBJ File Vertex Index Error</h4>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-30 -->\n\nI have one OBJ that causes an error.  It's a pyramid and I think it's causing a 0 size face attempt. But I don't know for sure. I can send the file if you want to check it.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2014-12-30 -->\n\nI can take a look at the pyramid problem, sure.</p>\n<p>I also want to look at that plane and check whether it has faces with more than four vertices...</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI provided two pyramid OBJs that crash the importer as I have it using AnyGeometry and fallback as Mesh.\nI tried to debug it, but didn't solve the problem, yet.</p>\n<p>Here is where \"pyramid.obj\" fails:</p>\n<pre>\nSystem.ArgumentOutOfRangeException was unhandled by user code\nMessage=Index was out of range.\nMust be non-negative and less than the size of the collection.\n</pre>\n<p>Do you get that error, too?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI would say there is an error in the pyramid OBJ file.</p>\n<p>How was it created?</p>\n<p>Look:</p>\n<pre>\n# OBJ file created by ply_to_obj.c\n#\ng Object001\n\nv  0  0  0\nv  1  0  0\nv  1  1  0\nv  0  1  0\nv  0.5  0.5  1.6\n\nf  5  2  3\nf  4  5  3\nf  6  3  2\nf  5  6  2\nf  4  6  5\nf  6  4  3\n</pre>\n<p>It defines five vertices.</p>\n<p>They are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>\n<p>The faces refer to faces numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.</p>\n<p>That is wrong.</p>\n<p>In addition, though, I ran into a strange problem debugging this.</p>\n<p>I fixed the vertex indices in the face by subtracting 2 from each one, but the add-in was still working with the old data.</p>\n<p>Currently, I can only imagine that the OBJ parsing library is caching something that it should not.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nYes, I think you are right. MeshLab brings it in without complaining but part of it appears to go to infinity.</p>\n<p>That OBJ was from a web page with lots of OBJs.</p>\n<p>I'd like to catch the error something like this, and just end the command. Is there a way to break out of the command from inside the loop if that error is encountered?</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  if (vertices.Count &gt; i.vertex)\n  {\n    MessageBox.Show(\"Error: Face and vertex quantities do not match.\");\n    return Result.Cancelled;\n  }\n</pre>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nCheck out the new\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.12\">version 2015.0.0.12</a>:\n\nabort and display error message on invalid OBJ file due to face vertex index exceeding total vertex count.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nThanks. Looks like you added messages to the top of the debug messages.\nDo you know of a method to cleanly quit an API app when an error is found?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nDo you mean abort and close down and exit the add-in? Or simply abort the current external command execution, but remain loaded for a renewed attempt?</p>\n<p>The former is not really common or supported by the Revit API. It would be possible, but why would you want that?</p>\n<p>The latter is exactly what I now do.</p>\n<p>It is achieved by returning from the external command Execute method.\nIts return values are Succeeded, Cancelled or Failed.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nI'd like to cleanly show an error message, then exit. Currently one gets a pile of debug stuff in the message when there is an error.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nRegarding exiting cleanly, I already explained:</p>\n<p>Return from the external command Execute method.\nIts return values are Succeeded, Cancelled or Failed.</p>\n<p>The 'pile of debug stuff' comes from an unhandled exception.</p>\n<p>You can either add a catch-all exception handler round your entire command and then decide for yourself what information is displayed before you return from Execute, or you can handle each exception separately in a targeted manner.</p>\n<p>The latter is only possible once you know what the exception is and what is causing it, though.</p>\n<p>I can add a catch-all exception handler to demonstrate, if you like.</p>\n<p>I implemented two exception handlers in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.13\">version 2015.0.0.13</a>.</p>\n<p>Please test and let me know how it goes.</p>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-05 -->\n\nWhat running your release DLL with \"pyramid.obj\" gets:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Invalid vertex index error message\" src=\"img/directobjloader_14.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Good.</p>\n<a name=\"8\"></a>\n<h4>Submitted to Autodesk Exchange Apps and Ribbon Panel Icon</h4>\n<p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-04 -->\n\nI did it.

My challenge this week is to get the app published without too much feature creep.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI fixed the OBJ loader to support faces with more than four vertices in\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jeremytammik/DirectObjLoader/releases/tag/2015.0.0.9\">version 2015.0.0.9</a>.</p><p>This enables partial loading of the sandal.obj sample file, but with some holes, similar to the untreated Cessna:</p><p>You want to watch out with your Memento clean-up... it destroys the OBJ groups and thus looses important model structure information.</p><p>Here is the complete Cessna cleaned up by Memento:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Cessna exported from Memento\" src=\"img/cessna-exported-from-Memento.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center><p>Here is the original one with model structure but lacking some faces:</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Cessna with groups and missing faces\" src=\"img/cessna_with_groups_and_missing_faces.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center><p>I switched TessellatedShapeBuilder target from Mesh to AnyGeometry as well, and it does indeed look a bit better.</p><p><strong>Response:</strong>\n<!-- 2015-01-02 -->\n\nI think AnyGeometry attempts to make a solid.\nIf a solid is made, dimensions can work on it.</p><p>The bigger issue is the smoothing data that are not processed in the original OBJ.
