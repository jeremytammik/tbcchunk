I tried as well but could not find this info anywhere in the properties. Can someone confirm if it's possible or should we recommend them to use Design Automation for this? Thanks!\n  image.png \n  image.png\n  /a/doc/revit/tbc/git/a/img/sheet_identity_data.png 1107\n  Traian Stanev  13 hours ago\n  It should be possible to get sheet properties by navigating the hierarchy of the object tree. The root node (id=1) is the document, and the sheets will be listed as children of that root. One would need to iterate through the children of the root to get the properties of the sheets and views.\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  Hi @Traian Stanev: Thanks. I do see the model as id=1 but I can't find sheets as children of that root. I also do not see \"Sheet\" in model browser in the Forge viewer in any example (which certainly contain Revit models having sheets). Am I overlooking something?\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  The model browser will not show sheets because they do not have physical geometry associated with them. However, there will be sheet objects as children of the root.\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  I don't know whether it's true for 100% of RVTs that sheets will appear in the property database though and it probably depends on which API you use to get properties. I'm referring to the full property database available to the Forge viewer. (edited) \n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  This is an export of the tree for my Revit model\n  Untitled \n  {\n      \"data\": {\n          \"type\": \"objects\",\n          \"objects\": [\n              {\n  Click to expand in-line (2,059 lines)\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  ^ this is /metadata\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  ..and this is /properties\n  Untitled \n  {\n      \"data\": {\n          \"type\": \"properties\",\n          \"collection\": [\n              {\n  Click to expand in-line (20,859 lines)\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  @Traian Stanev: and just FYI with the above snippets from /metadata and /properties, the sheet I'm looking is called \"A102 - Plans\". Thanks for the help btw :slightly_smiling_face: (edited) \n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  I can't really comment about what subset of element properties are returned by the Forge properties API.\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  I just know that the Forge viewer will show sheet properties in some cases, like in BIM360 Docs when you open the sheet.\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  @Traian Stanev: I don't think BIM 360 Docs shows properties of sheets. It does show properties of elements in that sheet, but since there's no way to \"select\" a sheet, we do not get the properties of the sheet. Let me do a quick check and confirm (edited) \n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  @Traian Stanev: nope, I stand corrected. BIM 360 does show those properties. I am just wondering now how does it get those properties. :open_mouth:\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  It does it like I said -- it loops through the children of the root node and find the sheet element with the matching name.\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  However, it's not using the Forge properties API.\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  It uses the raw property data, available to the Forge Viewer, and it does it like this: https://git.autodesk.com/A360/firefly.js/blob/develop/src/gui/ViewerPropertyPanel.js#L377\n  Namit Ranjan  12 hours ago\n  @Traian Stanev: I perhaps do not have the entitlement to access the above but I kind of understand what you're trying to say. I understand that the properties are being retrieved by the raw property data. However, to first select the element id, the hierarchy (from /metadata endpoint) should retrieve sheets, right? I don't see sheets in that response; or is it that there's also another raw data which is different than Forge metadata  API?\n  Traian Stanev  12 hours ago\n  The forge metadata endpoint is not raw, it's processed data. From the above, it looks like it's missing the child properties that will let you easily find the sheets from the root element.\n  Namit Ranjan  11 hours ago\n  @Traian Stanev: Thanks, this is very helpful. Final question is - can this raw data be accessed by a customer?\n  Traian Stanev  11 hours ago\n  Yes, using Forge Viewer.\n  Traian Stanev  11 hours ago\n  I think you could ask #forge-modelderivative for more details though. It's possible there is a way to get this information via metadata that I am not aware of.\n  Namit Ranjan  11 hours ago\n  okay, the customer probably wants to query and fetch attribute values (maybe plug those values in a DB, just thinking) and that won't be possible using Forge viewer, right?\n  Jim Quanci  20 days ago\n  The MD service does let you perform queries to get the metadata you want... with two choices of data format... yes the MD slack channel or @Augusto Goncalves can help.  Some small chance you will run into data MD doesnt collect and Revit Design Automation would be your fallback.\n  Namit Ranjan  20 days ago\n  Thanks @Jim Quanci, I'll put this up shortly on the MD channel. Also, @Augusto Goncalves, would be great if you could provide your input. Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:\n  Augusto Goncalves  20 days ago\n  sure, with Design Automation you can definitely extract additional data, see this sample: https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit\n  augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit\n  Extract Compound Structure Layer for RVT files using Design Automation for Revit\n  <https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit|augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit>augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit | 27 Mar | Added by GitHub\n  Namit Ranjan  20 days ago\n  @Augusto Goncalves: Thanks a lot.

It will hopefully be available in a future release of Revit.\n\nMeanwhile, the convoluted approach you describe sounds significantly better than nothing at all to me, so well done finding a way through the maze.\n\n **Response:** For anyone else who runs into this same need, here are some of my other findings:\n\n`Document.PathName` seems to be a string in this form when opening a cloud model:\n\n<pre>\n  BIM 360://&lt;DocsProjectName&gt;/&lt;ModelName&gt;.rvt\n</pre>\n\nSo, another option is to try parsing `Document.PathName` to get the Document Management Project name:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  string regexPattern =\n    @\"^BIM 360:\\/\\/(?&lt;ProjectName&gt;.*)\\/(?&lt;ModelName&gt;.*)$\";\n\n  if (Regex.IsMatch(doc.PathName, regexPattern))\n  {\n    Match match = Regex.Match( doc.PathName, regexPattern );\n    string projectName = match.Groups[\"ProjectName\"].Value;\n  }\n</pre>\n\nThen look for a project with that name by iterating each hub returned\nfrom *https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/hubs-GET/*,\nand, on each one, try\nto [get a project using a name filter](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/hubs-hub_id-projects-GET/), \nusing a filter such as\n\n<pre>\n  string.format( \"?filter[attributes.name]={0}\",\n    HttpUtility.UrlEncode(projectName))\n</pre> \n\nIf this project name isn't unique, then this approach might not get the correct one.\nBut additional processing can be applied to use a folder search looking for\n\n<pre>\n  attributes.extension.data.projectGuid\n    = &lt;ActiveRevitDocument&gt;.GetCloudModelPath().GetProjectGUID()\n</pre>\n\nSo at least this way, the folder search is only done on potential matches, rather than every single project.\n\nIf the Document Management project name changes, then `Document.PathName` won't refresh to the new project name until you re-save the model.\nSo, as a fallback, if I still haven't found the project Id, I resort to the folder search on every project regardless of name.\n\nNot ideal, but hopefully a direct method will be added to the Revit API in the future!\n\nMany thanks to Kevin for all his research and documentation work on this!"
