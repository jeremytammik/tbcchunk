According to buildingSMART, IFC “is a standardized, digital description of the built environment, including buildings and civil infrastructure. It is an open, international standard, meant to be vendor-neutral, or agnostic, and usable across a wide range of hardware devices, software platforms, and interfaces for many different use cases.”\n  Download version 2 of the manual here, available in 9 languages:    \n\n- AI solves small human programming puzzles\n  DeepMind says its new AI coding engine is as good as an average human programmer\n  https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914085/alphacode-ai-coding-program-automatic-deepmind-codeforce\n\ntwitter:\n\nA summary and a new, deeper look at Purge via Performance Advisor and eTransmit PurgeUnused functionality in DA4R in the #RevitAPI FormulaManager @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon https://autode.sk/purgetransmit\n\nToday, we return for a summary and a new, deeper look at a recurring topic\n&ndash; eTransmit documentation\n&ndash; Purge via performance advisor\n&ndash; eTransmit functionality in DA4R\n&ndash; Updated Autodesk Revit IFC manual\n&ndash; AI solves programming tasks...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nA summary and a new, deeper look at Purge via Performance Advisor and eTransmit PurgeUnused functionality in DA4R and the #RevitAPI\n\nhttps://autode.sk/purgetransmit\n\n- eTransmit documentation\n- Purge via performance advisor\n- eTransmit functionality in DA4R\n- Updated Autodesk Revit IFC manual\n- AI solves programming tasks...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n-->"
