The GUIDs are pre-defined by the system.\n\nThey can be obtained as described\nin [how to save a local file to a non-workshared cloud model](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/04/revit-2021-cloud-model-api.html#4.5).\n\nHere are some further, related discussions that I have been collecting and that may also be of interest:\n\n- [Save RVT from cloud to local file](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/doc-saveas-on-active-cloudmodel/m-p/9059906)\n- [Accessing BIM360 Models](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/12/forge-devcon-keynote-and-bim360-model-access.html#3)\n- [How to create URN for Revit file from Revit plugin or using Forge APIs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53538382/how-to-create-urn-for-revit-file-from-revit-plugin-or-using-forge-apis)\n- Forge blog post on [accessing BIM 360 design models on Revit](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/accessing-bim-360-design-models-revit)\n- [`IOpenFromCloudCallback` and the `DefaultOpenFromCloudCallback` class](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/05/precast-api-and-cloud-open-callback.html#3) &ndash; using the Revit 2019 API to detach a model from BIM360\n- [Accessing BIM360 cloud links](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#2)\n- [Update Revit custom properties by web API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54788232/update-revit-custom-properties-by-web-api)\n- [Open Revit BIM360 Model via command line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57806330/open-revit-bim360-model-via-command-line)\n- [Do we have API access to C4R (Collaboration for Revit) functionalities in Forge API/Revit API?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58483626/do-we-have-api-access-to-c4rcollaboration-for-revit-functionalities-in-forge-a)\n\nThe last one pretty exactly matches the question you have as well.\n\n**Response:** In my DA add-in, `SaveAsCloudCloudModel` was called with the following parameters:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  doc.SaveAsCloudModel(\n    new Guid(\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-x...x\"), // BIM360 docs AccountGUID\n    new Guid(\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-x...x\"), // BIM360 docs ProjectGUID\n    \"urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.folder:XXXXX...XXX%22, // BIM360 docs FolderID\n    \"test-floor-model.rvt\" // FileName to save\n  );\n</pre>\n\nThese GUIDs and IDs were determined as described\nin [how to save a local file to a non-workshared cloud model](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/04/revit-2021-cloud-model-api.html#4.5).\n\nHowever, the result was the same (log of DA WorkItem):\n\n<pre>\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40] Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions.InvalidOperationException: Could not obtain entitlement server.\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40]    at Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document.SaveAsCloudModel(Guid accountId, Guid projectId, String folderId, String modelName)\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40]    at IfcToRvt.Commands.ImportIFC(Document doc)\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40]    at IfcToRvt.Commands.DesignAutomationBridge_DesignAutomationReadyEvent(Object sender, DesignAutomationReadyEventArgs e)\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40]    at DesignAutomationFramework.DesignAutomationBridge.RaiseDesignAutomationReadyEvent(DesignAutomationReadyEventArgs e)\n  [10/08/2020 23:20:40]    at RevitCoreEngineTest.RceConsoleApplication.Program.UserMain(CommandLineArgs cl)\n</pre>\n\nIs there a mistake or misunderstanding in my code above?\n\n[Worksharing model support by Revit Design Automation](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/worksharing-model-support-revit-design-automation-0) clearly\nstates that DA can open a Worksharing model from C4R on BIM 360 docs.\n\nIs it possible for DA to save a RVT file as the C4R model on BIM360 docs?\n\n**Answer:** No, unfortunately that is currently not possible, as explained in [how to save Revit file in BIM 360 as cloud model using Forge Design Automation API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62307069/how-to-save-revit-file-in-bim-360-as-cloud-model-using-forge-design-automation-a):\n\n> It is a current limitation of Design Automation that model saves can only be done into the current working directory of the cloud machine.\nThis is because user apps are forbidden from accessing the network.\n\n> As such, `doc.SaveAsCloudModel` is not currently supported on Design Automation.\nThat said, we have noted your request for BIM 360 functionality in Design Automation!\n\nI checked with my colleagues whether this is still the case.\n\nThey answered: There is no alternative to save to RCW.\nOpen/Save operations on RCW are on the priority (no ETA).\n\nThank you for clarifying!\nSome further Q &amp; A on this:\n\n[Q] What exactly does RCW stand for, please?\nIs that equivalent to BIM360?\nIf not, what is the exact relationship between RCW, BIM360 and Forge, please? \n\n[A] Revit Cloud Worksharing (RCW) consists of the cloud service which sends and receives streams of element data from the cloud to your local model.\nBIM360 is the Cloud service which hosts the streams of element data and enables RCW workflow.\nBTW, it is suggested to use Revit Cloud Models rather than RCW.\n\n[Q] Thank you for clarifying RCW.\nThank you also for surprising me with a new acronym, RCM.\nYou say that RCM is recommended over RCW.\nWhat is RCM? Is that part of Forge, or BIM360, or yet something else?\nHow can we save to, or use, in general, RCM instead of RCW?\nCan `SaveAsCloudModel` save to both RCM and RCW?\nHow can that be controlled?\nThis sounds to me as if a whitepaper on the whole topic and all these acronyms would be more useful than answers to individual random question.\nDoes such a whitepaper exist, or some source of information, or overview?\n\n[A] Let me give it a shot, I believe this is an accurate overview:\n\n- BIM 360 = Unified platform which hosts a number of services (such as BIM 360 Document Management)\n- Revit Cloud Worksharing (RCW) = Service for Revit that supports multi-user collaboration, hosted on BIM 360 Document Management\n- Cloud Models for Revit (RCM) = Use Cloud Models for Revit to save your non-workshared, local model, hosted on BIM 360 Document Management\n\nOf these three, Design Automation for Revit can only access or save models on BIM 360.\n\nDesign Automation for Revit does not have access to and cannot sync, save, or open Revit cloud worksharing models, including Cloud Models for Revit.\nThese are considered the \"live\" versions of the model customers are actively working in.\n\nWhen a customer publishes a version of the \"live\" model, it ends up on BIM 360, and that is the version Design Automation for Revit can access. \n\n[Q] Then, I assume that the answer to the main question above is a clear und succinct ‘currently no’?\n\n[A] Correct.\n\nSo, all in all, there is currently no alternative to save to the Revit Cloud Worksharing (RCW).\n\nOpen/Save operations on RCW are high priority, but no ETA defined yet."
