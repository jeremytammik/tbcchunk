The thought is perhaps the objects became corrupted so deleting them and allowing the plugin to recreate new ones may resolve the issue, this did not work.\n- Audit the model\n- Disabling the plugin. This resolves the issue but the problem to solve is having the plugin not causing the issue for this user, this issue does not and has never occurred for any other user of the plugin.\n- Switching to a different Autodesk account. This does resolve the issue but project requirements require the user to use the specific account that has the issue.\n\nWhat can we do to resolve this issue, please? -- https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/extensiblesotrage-schemabuilder-addsimplefield-causes-quot/td-p/12527389\n\n**Answer:** There is a known improvement logged in REVIT-156791.\nThe issue is \"the `fieldName` is too long\".\nThe current limitation in Revit is we only accept the field name with length less than 63.\nWhy does the issue only happen on one specific user account?\nPlease ask the user to check with the plugin owner about the `fieldName`.\nIt is possible that this `fieldName` is generated based on the current user name.\n\nAnother issue that can occur: given the following code to set up 3 simple fields for the schema and set the documentation for those fields:\n\n<pre><code>FieldBuilder theVersion = schemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(VERSIONFIELD,\n  typeof (int)); // create a field to store the version number\nFieldBuilder theData = schemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(DATAFIELD,\n  typeof (string)); // create a field to store the data\nFieldBuilder isZipped = schemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(ZIPFIELD,\n  typeof (bool)); // create a field to store the data\ntheVersion.SetDocumentation(\"The version number of the schema of the stored data.\");\ntheData.SetDocumentation(\"The data as XML serialized, possibly zipped and base64 coded string.\");\nisZipped.SetDocumentation(\"Whether or not the stored data has been zipped.\");</code></pre>\n\nIn the above code, the first `SetDocumentation` call may fail.\nThe issue has to do with the way fields are added on each call to `AddSimpleField`.\nInternally, the fields are stored in a dynamic array and the return value of `AddSimpleField` is a pointer to the entry inside that array.\nSubsequent calls to `AddSimpleField` will add new entries into this array and return pointers to those.\nThe problem is that each addition may trigger the array to be resized.\nIn that case, it will be reallocated and all entries moved to the new allocation.\nThus, any reference pointers become obsolete at that point and are now pointing to the wrong/deleted thing.\nThat can cause a crash; release builds may seemingly work, but the memory is not the write (right) memory to place the string in.\n\nIn general, when working with `SchemaBuilder` and adding fields, it seems best to add the field, set its properties, then continue onto the next field etc.\nHence, the code above can be fixed as follows:\n\n<pre><code>// create a field to store the version number\nschemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(VERSIONFIELD, typeof (int))\n  .SetDocumentation(\"The version number of the schema of the stored data.\");\n// create a field to store the data\nschemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(DATAFIELD, typeof (string))\n  .SetDocumentation(\"The data as XML serialized, possibly zipped and base64 coded string.\");\n// create a field to store the data\nschemaBuilder.AddSimpleField(ZIPFIELD, typeof (bool))\n  .SetDocumentation(\"Whether or not the stored data has been zipped.\");</code></pre>"

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> Get All Apartment Rooms\n\n**Question:** I want to collect all room in a given apartment.\nThe user just selects one external door.\nSo far, I have implemented this collection of rooms in the apartment using the properties `FromRoom` and `ToRoom`.\nNow, I encountered a case where rooms are not separated by a door but by a room separator:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/get_rooms_1.png\" alt=\"Get adjacent rooms\" title=\"Get adjacent rooms\" width=\"500\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 743 Pixel Width: 1,176 -->\n</center>\n\nIn this case, the logic above fails.\nHow can I handle this case?\n\n**Answer:**\nYou have to do both the doors and the room separations.\nSo, after you pull the doors from the room, pull it's boundary segments using\nthe [GetBoundarySegments method](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/8e0919af-6172-9d16-26d2-268e42f7e936.htm).\nThen, for each segment, check if the bounding element type is a room separation.\nIf so, evaluate a point at the middle of the curve, and translate it just inside and just outside the curve.\nPull the room at those points and you get the one room which is your active room, and one room which is the adjacent one.\nAdd the adjacent one to your list of rooms to process, and the list of 'included' rooms.\n\nSome supplementary thoughts: there might be some complicated cases where one room separation line is the boundary of more than two rooms:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/get_rooms_2.png\" alt=\"Get adjacent rooms\" title=\"Get adjacent rooms\" width=\"300\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 269 Pixel Width: 377 -->\n</center>\n\nOne way to handle this is to record the boundary information in a `Dictionary<ElementId, List<ElementId>>`, where the key is the element id of the boundary segment, and the value is the elements that are bounded by that segment.\nYou can loop through all rooms to construct the dictionary.\n\nPossibly, though, the `GetBoundarySegments` call on room three will return a segment for the boundary to room one and a separate segment for the boundary to room 2; in that case there shouldn’t be much of a concern with tracking.\nWorth checking, though.\nThen, GetBoundarySegments should be enough for this request.\n\nThere are many solutions to this.\nSo, it’s up to you."
