These are all independent to install so just download the ones you want. There is some nuance to the installation but nothing terrible.\n\n- [GasTools](https://github.com/GastonBC/GasTools/wiki) &ndash; tools I've developed over the years to make my life easier using Revit.\nThey automate repetitive tasks or provide a better way of visualizing the information, like the location of linked and imported CADs, legends. Examples of use are in the referenced links.\n- Match Grid Extents &ndash; This tool lets you copy the layout of the grids in a sheet (for example the elbows, 2D extents and bubble visibility) and transfer it to another view. It also reveals and hides grids according to the view chosen as template.\n- Outline Elevations &ndash; If you've ever done elevations, you are used to making fill regions around the enclosing walls and giving it a pen thickness. This tool takes the crop region extent and overrides its thickness to the desired number.\n- Auto Dimension Grids &ndash; Dimension your selected grids automatically to the top and the left.\n- Smart Grid Bubbles &ndash; Turn the top and left grid bubbles on.\n- Set by Index &ndash; Create a sheet set by selecting a schedule like the one in your cover sheet instead of checking sheet by sheet."

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> Key Schedule Browser API\n\nJacob Small, Autodesk Implementation Consultant, chipped in with some new advice on how to control the hierarchy of the schedule in the project browser in the thread\non [Key Schedule + Revit API](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/key-schedule-revit-api/m-p/12143666):\n\n**Question:** I have previously asked about using Revit API to create a Key Schedule and add bunch of new parameters to it.\nThat question is still out here somewhere so I am not going to repeat it here.\nInstead, I just manually added bunch of parameters to Key Schedule and moved on to the next task.\nI was able to access Data Table and add more rows to the data.\nWhat I am trying to do now, is to fill the cells with data.\nObviously, there is no clear method for that.\nHence my question: How does one, using API, fill in the Key Schedule data?\nAny ideas/suggestions are welcome.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/key_schedule_api.jpg\" alt=\"Key schedule API\" title=\"Key schedule API\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 460 Pixel Width: 460 -->\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** A keyschedule behaves in most ways just like a normal schedule.\nThe most important similarity being that they show a collection of elements.\nConfusion can arise when thinking about the elements in the keyschedule, because they do not physically exist in the Revit model.\nI like to think of them as 'ghost elements', who's image (= set of parameter values) can be imprinted on real elements.\n\nThis being the case, the elements in the keyschedule can be simply retrieved by using a `FilteredElementCollector` with the `KeyScheduleID` as an argument.\nParameters shown in the keyschedule can then be retrieved and set in the elements themselves.\nThe newly set parameter values will then of course show up in the key schedule.\n\n**Response:** This solution works pretty well!\n\nNow just to make it clear for everyone here's what really happens:\n\nEach row in a Key Schedule is an Element that contains a set of Parameters.\nParameters represent each column of the schedule.\n\nWe can collect all \"rows\" (elements) just by doing this:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  elements = FilteredElementCollector(doc, viewSchedule.Id).ToElements()\n</pre>\n\nThen we can query each element that is being returns for parameters:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  params = []\n  for i in elements:\n    params.append(i.Parameters)\n</pre>\n\nOnce you have the parameters, you can just write values to them and they will appear in a schedule.\n\nNot all parameters represent a field in the key schedule, though.\nBut that can be easily filtered out by checking the parameter's definition name toward schedulable fields.\n\nMaybe the Revit API SDK team can include some of the code in the schedule samples, before a more intrinsic method for reaching this goal being created.\n\n**Question:** Which parameter is responsible of defining the hierarchy of the schedule in project browser, at the question marks in this picture?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/key_schedule_in_browser.jpg\" alt=\"Key schedule in browser\" title=\"Key schedule in browser\" width=\"390\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 306 Pixel Width: 390 -->\n</center>\n\nNo elements are collected by this code:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  Category category = Category.GetCategory(doc, BuiltInCategory.OST_Rooms);\n  viewSchedule = ViewSchedule.CreateKeySchedule(doc, category.Id);\n  FilteredElementCollector elementCollector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc, viewSchedule.Id);\n  IList&lt;Element&gt; rows = elementCollector.ToElements();\n</pre>\n\n**Answer:** This is something I've taken a stab at in the past for a Dynamo project, so I'll weigh in.\n\nFirst thing to know: the project browser is a view of the model itself and can be organised in different ways per project.\nAs always, you want to explore how things are in the UI before attempting to automate it, so first check info on managing it manually:\n[Organizing the Project Browser](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2024/ENU/?guid=GUID-96F9CDB5-C46D-4597-943B-DF231E8EC688)\n\nFrom there we can look at managing it via the API.\nFor that there is the\nhandy [`BrowserOrganization` class](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/4fd57c3f-6127-efd9-f79e-70ad3e5dc1cc.htm).\n\nSo, while we could manage the setup, we don't know how your browser is organized on a given project (and if your code is intended to scale across orgs/projects you can't assume there is a single setup).\nAs such, you likely want to start off by looking at\n[the GetCurrentBrowserOrganizationForSchedules method](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/b32365b9-54d0-08b3-ee34-4a2cde7fa1d8.htm)\n\nGood luck! &nbsp;   :-)\n\nMille grazie, Jacob!"
