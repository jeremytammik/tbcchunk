I looked at the ObjectViewer sample in the SDK, and incorporated the viewer for objects there into my project, but I have two questions.</p><ol>\n<li>Can it be used to render previews that are of \"better\" quality than wireframe?</li>\n<li>The demo only accepts one object, I tried with a window FamilyInstance and that didn't render properly, only came out grey; I tried with a wall and that looked OK, and I could move it about.</li>\n</ol><p>What I am trying to do is previewing/rendering a view of a family instance.</p><p>Any thoughts, suggestions?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Since you have the ElementViewer and ObjectViewer source code included in the Revit SDK, you can basically answer these questions yourself.</p><p>For your convenience, I'll state that both of those samples make use of an extremely simple little custom renderer that only draws lines.</p><p>You would have to replace that and also implement hidden line removal and a bunch of other stuff to do anything more complex.</p><p>I would not recommend using this at all for any professional application.</p><p>Its main use is to understand and debug the geometry traversal and associated transformations.</p><p>There are tons of better rendering options around.</p><p>To start with, you might be able to make use of the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/appstore-advice-and-zooming-in-a-preview-control.html#4\">\nRevit API PreviewControl</a>.</p><p>For more advanced rendering interaction outside of Revit, there is also the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.46\">\nAutodesk View and Data API</a>.</p><p>We also implemented a simpler WebGL and three.js based viewer at the AEC Hackathon last year, basically a simpler version of the Autodesk View and Data API, called\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/threejs-aec-viewer-progress-on-two-fronts.html\">\nvA3C</a>.</p><p>These are just three possibilities out of many.</p><p><strong>Response:</strong> Hi Jeremy and thank you for pointing me in the right direction.</p><p>After trying out several things, I figured that the external web viewer is overkill for my needs and the ObjectViewer example as you stated isn't suited for my needs.</p><p>I managed to display a 3D view of selected objects with the PreviewControl, but I don't seem to get the perspective I want or the current perspective in Revit.</p><p>I was wondering if there was a simpler way to achieve the preview window you get when you try to export in GbXML format?</p><p>This is what I'm aiming for, because I'm adding properties to families and the user has to be able to name those properties from visual cues seen in the 3D preview of the family. </p><p>And since I'm writing an add-in using Winforms I would rather not use a webpage.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> I think maybe you should play around a bit with the various WebGL solutions after all.</p><p>Once you have gotten the hang of them, you may discover that they nowadays provide the handiest, most flexible, versatile and low footprint solution of all.</p><p>Regarding Winforms versus web pages: it is in fact possible to host an own web browser inside your own Windows form, e.g. using the embedded Chrome library.</p><p>It would be easier to just use the pre-installed browser, though.</p><p>Are you aware of any computer system of interest to your users lacking a built-in browser?</p><p>Regarding how to set up the preview control view: the PreviewControl does not take any input whatsoever beyond what you supply to its constructor.\nIn the constructor, you specify the Revit view to be displayed.\nHowever, you can create a dedicated Revit view for that specific purpose and set it up using all the Revit API view control functionality.</p><p>That should really provide all you need.</p><p>I hope this helps.</p><a name=\"5\"></a>"
