You can learn about the Autodesk Cloud Platform [Forge](https://forge.autodesk.com/), as well as network with Autodesk engineers and other developers working with Autodesk APIs. \n\nPersonally, I am attending the following sessions in USA and Europe:\n\n- United States\n    - November 14, 2016 &ndash; DevDay at AU, Las Vegas\n    - November 15, 2016 &ndash; DevLab at AU, Las Vegas\n- Germany\n    - December 5, 2016 &ndash; DevDay, Munich\n    - December 6-9, 2016 &ndash; Accelerator, Munich\n\nIf you have already registered to attend one of the events &ndash; congratulations, me and my colleagues look forward to seeing you soon!\n\nIf not, read on.\n\nRegistration for DevDays Las Vegas is via the [Autodesk University website](http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/pre-conference/adn-conference-devdays).\nRegister and choose your sessions here.\n\nIf you are attending another Monday conference at AU and therefore cannot register for DevDays but would like to drop in at one or more DevDay sessions, please let us know so that we can add you to a list for special access.  Just send us an [email to adnreg@autodesk.com](mailto:adnreg@autodesk.com) with your name and company name and we’ll take care of it.\n\nRegistration for Asia and Europe is easy.  Simply visit the event website at [www.autodeskdevdays.com](http://autodeskdevdays.com) for full information and click on the [Register button](http://autodeskdevdays.com/register)."
