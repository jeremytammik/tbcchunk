The problem is, this change will take hours of tedious work... hours you simply don't have. However, through the power of the Revit software API and some basic knowledge of computer programming, you can write macros to automate Revit software and save a ton of time on your next project. This lab is designed to get you started automating Revit software using macros written in the Microsoft Visual Basic .NET programming language. Over the course of this lab, we'll cover programming basics and dive into the Revit software API. We'll do this by writing useful macros you can take back to your office and put to good use. At the end of the class you'll have a solid foundation from which to start writing your own macros. Take command of your software and learn to program! This class is geared toward intermediate-to-advanced Revit software users with little or no programming experience.\n\n- Discover the differences between Revit macros, add-ins, and external applications.\n- Learn how to create custom macros in Revit using the Revit macro editor and the C# and VB.NET programming languages.\n- Learn how to utilize resources from the Revit Software Development Kit to get more information about .NET and the Revit API.\n- Learn how to create time-saving macros using a step-by-step process to break complex problems into manageable tasks.\n\nHere are the RTC handout document and slide deck that Michael created for me, providing full instructions on how to easily and efficiently get started with Revit macros:\n\n- [Slide desk](/a/doc/revit/rtc/2015/doc/s1_2_pres_revit_macros_jtammik.pdf)\n- [Handout document](/a/doc/revit/rtc/2015/doc/s1_2_handout_revit_macros_jtammik.pdf)\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the pleasure of Internet search engines and above all Revit API students, here is the full handout text direct and live:"

Macros do not require any additional software other than Revit and are a great way for beginners to learn programming.\n\nSo what exactly is a macro? A macro is a user created command that is coded using Revit’s API or Application Programming Interface. Macros are run directly inside of Revit and are saved in the project file. Other applications, like Microsoft Excel and Word, also have the ability to create macros. Revit macros are different from those in Excel and Word because you cannot record actions directly into a macro. Revit macros must be coded by hand."

You can use C# to develop stand-alone desktop applications.\n￼￼The language syntax is not as readable as other languages. The code is more terse, is case sensitive and uses obscure symbols\n- VB.NET: Evolved from Microsoft’s Visual Basic Language\n￼￼VB.NET code is easier to read than C#. The language is not as strict as C#. You can use VB.NET to develop desktop applications.\n￼￼VB.NET is “wordier” than C# it takes more lines of code to do the same thing. Some say the language isn’t as elegant as other languages.\n- Python: Created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.\n ￼Lots of general code samples and learning resources available. Easy to learn. Python code is very readable. Can build web and desktop apps using Python.\n￼ Not many Revit specific code samples available online yet. Some debugging features not available in SharpDevelop\n- Ruby: Created in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto.\n ￼Lots of general code samples and learning resources available. Easy to learn.

Open the RevitAPI.chm file and click the “Content” tab. The help file lists all of the namespaces in the Revit API.\n\nA namespace is essentially a hierarchical container for the elements within the API. A good analogy for namespaces is your computer’s folder structure. Each folder at the same level of the directory structure must have a unique name. The folders can contain similarly named files but the path to each file will be unique as the folder names are unique. Namespaces work the same way. There may be elements within the API that are named the same. For example, many elements have a “Geometry” property but namespaces provide a way to accurately identify which geometry you’re specifying. To reference the wall geometry property, you type Autodesk.Revit.DB.Wall.Geometry.\n\nTo find more information about a specific element within the API, simply drill down through the namespaces to find the element. For instance, if I want to learn more about the properties of wall objects, I click Autodesk.Revit.DB Namespace > Wall Class > Wall Properties. The help file lists all the properties of wall elements.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_macros_13.png\" alt=\"Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm\" width=\"400\">\n</center>\n\nReading the API help file is not easy. It takes some practice as it is not written in plain English. Rather, it is a description of all the elements within the API. The help file does contain code samples but it not a learning tool. Much like a road map will not teach you to drive a car, the API help file will not teach you to code but it will help you get where you’re going."

One of the great things about coding is that the feedback is immediate. You write some code, compile it then run it. Your code will either work or it will not. Revit will tell you immediately if it does not work and you will feel a sense of accomplishment when it does work. SharpDevelop provides a number of tools to assist you while troubleshooting your code."

Writing code is an iterative process and you will need feedback as you develop your macro. SharpDevelop’s output window is useful for understanding what’s going on inside your macro.\n\nTo output information to the output window, use the Debug.Print command. Before you can use the command, however, you’ll need to add the Systems.Diagnostics namespace to your macro. You do this by adding “using System.Diagnostics” to the beginning of your macro code.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_macros_14.png\" alt=\"Systems.Diagnostics namespace\" width=\"300\">\n</center>"

These comments should serve as a reminder for what the code does and why it’s structured in that particular way.\n\nEach language has its own syntax for writing comments. Comments are identified in C# by a double slash (//) at the beginning of the line. SharpDevelop highlights all comments in green.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/revit_macros_17.png\" alt=\"C# comment\" width=\"201\">\n</center>\n\nComments can also be used to block code from running. Say you are testing some alternate approaches to a specific part of the macro. You can “comment out” parts of the code that you do not want to run. If you have three options for the code, comment out two and run the macro with one of the options. Commenting out can also be used to test very specific parts of your macro. If you are getting errors from one section of the macro, comment out everything else, build the macro and step through it. This focused approach will save you a lot of time while troubleshooting."

Even if your code compiles without an error, it can still crash or throw an exception when you run it. This is simply the nature of coding. If you get an error, use the methods listed above to systematically work through your code to identify the problem. This can seem like finding a needle in a haystack when you are first starting out but as you code more and more macros, you will get better at identifying problems in your code."

Which of these do you like the least? Would you like to automate it? Could you write a macro that would do the task for you?"
