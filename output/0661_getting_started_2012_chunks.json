Setting up the Environment</h4>\n<p>The first step is to obtain and set up a development environment.\nThis includes the Revit product itself, the Revit API, the Revit SDK (Software Developer Kit), and the development environment.\n\n<p><strong>Revit Product:</strong> You can download the latest version of released products from the Autodesk product page.  \nGo to <a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com\">www.autodesk.com</a>, look under the 'Products' menu, 'Alphabetically.'  \nFrom each Revit product page, look under Product Download. \nFollowing are examples of the links at the time of writing (Note: exact link may change): \n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=9262388\">Revit Architecture</a>\n<li><a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=9339705\">Revit Structure</a>\n<li><a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=9262907\">Revit MEP</a>\n</li></li></li></ul>\n\nWithout an activation code, you can use Revit in viewing-only mode. \n\n<p><strong>Revit API:</strong> The Revit API is provided by the .NET assemblies RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll, which are present in every Revit installation under \n\n<pre>&lt;Revit install&gt;\\Program</pre>\n<p><strong>Revit SDK:</strong> The Revit SDK is included in every Revit installation.  \n\n<p>The SDK installation can be launched from the 'Install Tools and Utilities' menu on the main page of the Revit installer. \nThere is another menu called 'Utilities' you see right after the product installation, which contains only the link 'Content Batch Utilities'. \nClick on the 'Back to First Page' button to move back to the main page of the installer to install the SDK. \n\n<p>Alternatively, you can also find the SDK in the extraction folder, under:\n\n<pre>&lt;extraction folder&gt;\\support\\SDK\\RevitSDK.exe</pre>\n<p>If you have accepted the default location, it typically looks like this: \n\n<pre>C:\\Program Files\\Autodesk\\Revit XXX 2012\\support\\SDK\\RevitSDK.exe</pre>\n<p>Note that the SDK may be updated by intermediate releases.  \nMake sure you check for the latest version either on the members-only ADN site or the public \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>.\n\n<p>The SDK includes Revit API documentation. \nThe most important items are the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm and the developer guide \"Revit 2012 API Developer Guide.pdf\".\nIt also includes many samples.\n\n<p><strong>Development Environment:</strong> Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) 2010 for Revit 2012. \nYou may also use VS 2008 + SP1, but debugging a Revit 2012 add-in does not work in that environment. \nAll the SDK samples are provided for VS 2010. \nThe Visual Studio Express editions can also be used.\n\n\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n<h4>2. Where to Start</h4>\n<p>(1) Watch the training video – The best way to start is to watch our DevTV recording, posted towards the bottom on the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>.\n \n<p>If you are new to programming in general as well, take a look at the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin\">My First Revit Plug-in</a> training material.\n\n<p>You can also have a look at last year's \n\n<a href=\"http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/RevitAPI_20May2010.zip\">Revit 2011 API webcast recording</a>.\n\n<p>It covers the basics of the Revit API since 2011. \nNote that the Revit API underwent a major renovation in 2011. \nThe webcast materials include the recording itself, the Powerpoint presentation, and training labs code.  \nYou can also find it on the ADN web site, under the Revit knowledgebase section, or from the Developer Center \n\n<a href=\"http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php\">\nTraining Course Schedule</a> and\n\n<a href=\"http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_webcast_archive.php\">\nWebcast Archive</a>. \n\n<p>The latest training labs for Revit 2012 are posted on the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>.\n\n<p>This year's <a href=\"http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/Autodesk_Revit_2012_API_Update.zip\">Revit 2012 API webcast</a> covers several major API enhancements.\n\n<p>If you are interested in Family API, there is a \n\n<a href=\"http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/Revit_2010_Family_API_Webcast-July2009.zip\">\nRevit Family API webcast recording</a>, too. \n\n<p>(2) Work through the latest hands-on training labs, which are available from the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>\n\n(scroll down toward the bottom). \n\n<p>(3) Try implementing and running the HelloRevit sample by yourself, for example following the steps described in Chapter 2, Walkthroughs, in the developer guide.\nGo through the Labs code, and look at some Revit SDK samples. \nThe following SDK samples will be a good starting point: \n\n<ul>\n<li>RevitCommands\n<li>Fire Rating\n<li>Viewers/ElementViewer\n<li>CreateBeamsColumnsBraces\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<a name=\"3\"></a>\n<h4>3.
