The point within the location object can be get and set. This is the location of the room within the level. The Z location should be the elevation of the level and is not changeable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also read its level by using the LEVEL_NAME or ROOM_LEVEL_ID parameters. Unfortunately, these parameters are both read-only:</p>\n<pre>\nLEVEL_NAME     String/Text  read-only  \"Level 1\"\nROOM_LEVEL_ID  ElementId    read-only  Levels 13071 'Level 1'\n</pre>\n<p>It has properties to read its creation and demolishment phases, and they are also marked as read-only:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PhaseCreated: the phase when the element is created.</li>\n<li>PhaseDemolished: the phase when the element is to be demolished.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I do not see any way to directly modify the level or phase properties of an existing room.</p>\n<h4>Ideas for creating a new Room with specific Level and Phase</h4>\n<p>The following overloads can be used to create a new room or place an existing one:</p>\n<pre>\n  Room NewRoom( Phase );\n  Room NewRoom( Level, UV point );\n  Room NewRoom( Room, PlanCircuit );\n</pre>\n<p>A previous post on\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/plantopology-class.html\">\nplan topology</a>\n\nand the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/plantopology-class.html\">\nCmdPlanTopology command</a>\n\nshows how to use the latter overload to create a new room.</p>\n<p>You can also use it to place an existing unplaced room.
