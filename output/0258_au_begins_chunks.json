I will pass by there regularly and definitely be spending time there on Wednesday around 12:30 and 19:30.\n\n<a name=\"photo\"></a>\n<h4>Sunday before the Storm</h4>\n<p>The last hours before the conference I spent enjoying a nice, peaceful, sunny Sunday walking, reading and climbing a little bit in Red Rock, once again in the Black Corridor.\nI had one quick climb on a top rope with Chris and Daniela on Burros Don't Gamble 5.10c, and two climbs with Hannah and Jason, semi leading with the quickdraws already placed, on Vagabonds 5.10a and Burros Might Fly 5.10b.\n\n<p>Jess very friendlily sent me some photos from our climbs together on Friday:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010347.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010348.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010349.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010350.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010351.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010355.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010356.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010361.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010377.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010378.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010379.JPG\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Here I am in the beginning of a route that was too hard for me and I was unable to complete.\nBut I was able to get down again safely the same way I went up:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010380.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010381.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010382.JPG\"/>\n<img alt=\"Climbing in Red Rock Canyon\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010383.JPG\"/>\n</center>\n<p>And finally, here we are having a beer together after the successful day, Karl, Gary, Fritz, Ellis, and Jess, the crazy guys from Dallas, Texas, and me at the end, maybe a bit crazy as well:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Crazy guys from Dallas\" src=\"/j/photo/jeremy/2009/2009_11_27_red_rock/P1010401.JPG\"/>\n</center>\n</p></p></p></p></p>"
