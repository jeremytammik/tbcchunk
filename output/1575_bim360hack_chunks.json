This year, the hackathon is dedicated to apps that use the [BIM 360 API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview).\n \nThis hackathon is a great way to quickly climb the BIM 360 + Forge API integration learning curve with Autodesk engineers close at hand (virtually) to grow your business by integrating with BIM 360.  The seven web training sessions give you a head start addressing opportunities across the entire building and infrastructure lifecycle and help you discover what you can achieve by leveraging Forge APIs with BIM 360. You don't have to take part in the hackathon to attend the webinars, but registration for the webinars is required.  Sign up once for the webinar series and attend any webinar you want. All webinars will be recorded:\n\n- August 15 &ndash; BIM 360 business opportunities with AppStore\n- August 16 &ndash; Introduction to BIM360 and Forge API\n- August 17 &ndash; Authentication and Data Management\n- August 18 &ndash; Model Derivative API\n- August 22 &ndash; Viewer\n- August 23 &ndash; BIM 360 Account Level API\n- August 24 &ndash; Submitting BIM360 App to Autodesk AppStore\n \n[Registration for the BIM 360 Online Hackathon](https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com) is open right now.\n \nDuring the hackathon introduction webinar on August 15th, we’ll be talking about what you can do right now to integrate with BIM 360 and provide an early look at the API roadmap (i.e., programmatic access to Issues, BIM 360 UI integration, and more).\n \nAnother reason to work on BIM 360 integration sooner rather than later is we’ll be launching a BIM 360 app 'Showcase' on [www.autodesk.com](http://www.autodesk.com) plus a BIM 360 app storefront in the Autodesk App Store in the next few weeks.  Being present in the Showcase and the App Store BIM 360 storefront when they first 'open' is a great way to get maximum exposure for your business with Autodesk BIM 360 customers (while there are still just a few dozen apps, so you don’t risk getting lost in the crowd later, when hundreds are added).\n \nFor all new apps on the BIM 360 platform submitted to the Autodesk App Store and accepted for publication in the store, a reward of 500 USD will be given, for one eligible app per entrant.\n \nCheck out the [full hackathon details including how to enter and the rules](https://bim360hackathon.devpost.com).\n \nYou don’t have to have an app in mind or even be a developer to participate in or benefit from the Hackathon.  Join us to learn more about the opportunities to tap into the construction industry’s digital transformation by creating apps and seamless experiences that leverage the Forge APIs to extend BIM 360.\n \nIf you have any questions, please send an email to [bim360hackathon@autodesk.com](mailto:bim360hackathon@autodesk.com)."

My way is to just place ReferencePlanes and snoop the coordinates with RevitLookup.\nOne option to display them would be to create ReferencePlanes surrounding the bounding box in the different views or just create an Extrusion or something occupying the space of the bounding box.\n\nKevin's new code is integrated into\nthe [FamilyBoundingBox add-in](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FamilyBoundingBox)\n[release 2017.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FamilyBoundingBox/releases/tag/2017.0.0.1).\n\nMany thanks to Kevin for sharing this!"
