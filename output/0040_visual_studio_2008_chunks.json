Officially, as stated in \"Getting Started Revit API 2009.doc\", the only supported Revit application development environment is Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition. Due to the interoperability between versions you can use 2008 anyway. You may have to avoid making use of certain features, though, such as new C# 3.0 constructs or newly added libraries, since the Revit API requires the Microsoft .NET Framework version 2.0.</p>"
