Since the app is in-house developed, I wonder: is it always necessary to have a certificate also for in-house trusted area?\"\n \nAnswer: The answer is yes; the warning will always be issued.\n\nOur security architect adds:\n \nThe add-in must be signed with an approved cert or it will display the popup on first load.\n \nWe've documented the process\nof [creating a self-signed cert that can be used for your own internal use](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2017/ENU/?guid=GUID-B9A067F4-234F-47F8-A5EE-0D84A93FA98E).\n \nYou\ncan <a href=\"https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd807084(v=ws.11).aspx\">push the cert to machines in your domain using group policy</a>.\n \nIf you both sign the add-in and push the cert to domain machines, users can use the add-in without the popup."

[2017.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.0)\n&ndash; initial flat migration to Revit 2017\n&ndash; [diffs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2016.0.0.10...2017.0.0.0)\n&ndash; [25 warnings](zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_01.txt)\n2. [2017.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.1)\n&ndash; cleaned up various paths pointing to 2016\n&ndash; [diffs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.0...2017.0.0.1)\n3. [2017.0.0.2](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.2)\n&ndash; fixed all warnings about deprecated API usage except Automatic transaction mode\n&ndash; [diffs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.1...2017.0.0.2)\n&ndash; [35 warnings](zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_02.txt)\n4. [2017.0.0.3](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.3)\n&ndash; eliminated some of the deprecated Automatic transaction mode usages\n&ndash; [diffs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.2...2017.0.0.3)\n&ndash; [29 warnings](zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_03.txt)\n5. [2017.0.0.4](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.4)\n&ndash; eliminated all deprecated Automatic transaction mode usage in all C# modules except Lab3.cs\n&ndash; [diffs](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.3...2017.0.0.4)\n&ndash; [19 warnings](zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_04.txt)\n\n19 warnings about use of the obsolete and deprecated automatic transaction mode remain, so I am still not completely done.\n\nIn any case, these diffs and logs should give you a very clear idea of how to approach any migration issues that you may encounter.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/little_house_3d_view.png\" alt=\"Little house\" width=\"380\">\n</center>"
