The general Line category can have many Line Style subcategories, and all subcategories of the Line category apparently *are* line styles.</p><p>To get to line patterns, you use a FilteredElementCollector.OfClass (LinePatternElement).</p><p>Line Patterns have a name and a list of LineSegment classes, each which has a Length double and an enum LineSegmentType (e.g. dash, dot or space).</p><p>Each line style can have exactly 1 line pattern or no line patterns.  What we need to find out is which line pattern (if any) is related to each line style (subcategory).  There does not seem to be, for example, a LinePattern property on the Category class (Category class is used for both Categories and SubCategories, so in reality a Line Style is of the Category class).</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> This was discussed not long ago in the following Q &amp; A:</p><p><b>[Q]</b> The Revit documentation says that Line Patterns are used in the definition of GraphicsStyle objects: \"A line pattern is a pattern of dashes and dots used to control the way the lines of an object are drawn in Revit. Line patterns are used in the definition of GraphicsStyle objects. A line pattern is defined by a repeating sequence segments. Each segment is a dash, a dot or a space. A line pattern definition must contain an even number of segments, starting with a visible segment (a dash or a dot) and alternating between visible segments and spaces.\" However, I could not find any APIs to connect these objects. How are these objects connected and how to use the APIs to connect them?</p><p><b>[A]</b> Revit does currently not expose the API to set or get a GraphicsStyle object's line pattern element. Users can only change/get the line pattern for GraphicsStyle object via the Revit UI. You can create a new line pattern element in Revit 2014 using its constructor to create a LinePattern object: LinePattern(String). You can call the LinePattern.SetSegment() method to create customized line patterns. You can create a LinePatternElement via LinePatternElement.Create(LinePattern).</p><p>Based on that, I don't think we currently expose any link between GraphicsStyle and line pattern. I don't think we even have the ability to get a line pattern directly from the category.</p><p>However, you can get the pattern id for a specific view via two OverrideGraphicSettings properties: ProjectionLinePatternId and CutLinePatternId. These get the value from the Visibility/Graphics dialog, not object styles. Not sure if it will return the object styles value if it's not overridden in the view.</p><p>Clearing up a few incorrect assumptions in the query itself:</p><ul>\n<li>Line style != subcategory or category. It's not a 1:1 relationship.</li>\n<li>Each category and subcategory has two GraphicsStyles: cut and projection (selected via GraphicsStyleType). Each style has a color, weight &amp; pattern reference.</li>\n<li>Patterns are shared by multiple styles, so you can't map back from a line pattern back to a single line style or category because it's a one to many relationship.</li>\n</ul>"
