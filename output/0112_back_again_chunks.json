Can you please point me towards resources for calling the Revit API from unmanaged C++?</li>\n<li>Is there any way of tagging objects from a linked file into a host file?</li>\n<li>RstLink: I am working in C# and have eliminated the VB projects from the RstLink solution. I assume their functionality is identical? The solution also includes a C++ project which I cannot compile, because it is lacking the file 'arxHeaders.h'. Where can I obtain this file? What is the use of this C++ project?</li>\n<li>MidasLink: I am compiling the 2008 version of the MidasLink source code with the 2009 API. This is causing errors because some parameters are passed by reference. Do you have the 2009 version of the code?</li>\n</ul>"

Can you please point me towards resources for calling the Revit API from unmanaged C++?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you wish to work with the Revit API in unmanaged C++, you will have to use mixed mode to access it.\nThe Revit API is managed. \nThere is no unmanaged access.\nUsing mixed mode, you can combine your unmanaged code and the managed code to access the Revit API in the same application.\nAn example is provided in the Revit API\n\n<!-- <a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/rac_tips_20090303.zip\"><span class=\"at-xid-6a00e553e168978833011168a75d18970c\">tips and tricks sample code</span></a> -->\n<a href=\"zip/rac_tips_20090303.zip\">\n\ntips and tricks sample code</a>.</p>"
