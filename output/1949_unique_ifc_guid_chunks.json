    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"4\"></a> You Cannot Control the Unique Id\n\n**Question:** How can I generate elements that have specific GUID? \n\nExample - I have one or more elements and GUIDs that I want; I need to create an element having that GUID.\n\n**Answer:** If you are speaking about `Element.UniqueId` then the answer is no, those are generated by Revit.\n\nThis applies to both `ElementId` and `UniqueId`. These unique identifiers are auto-generated. There is NO way you could specify these yourself or assign them manually to an element.\n\nIf you are in a situation with such a requirement, there is a flaw in your workflow design and architecture.\n\nYou can probably solve it by using some other identifier.\nIf you need to define the identifier yourself, then do so.\n\nYou cannot expect Revit or any other software to generate a GUID according to your specification.\n\nAn example of generating and storing your own GUID to identify a project that could also be used for individual BIM elements is given by the [named GUID storage for project identification](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/named-guid-storage-for-project-identification.html).\n\n**Response:** We need it for IFC export.\nIn our workflow, we have a master database from which we need to generate and re-generate objects in Revit.\nWe would like that when exported to IFC, their GlobalId is set to something that we have generated in our own project, not newly assigned by Revit each case.\n\n**Answer:** Well, sorry, you read all the unanimous answers above.\nYou can easily program a workaround.\nYou will not be able to force Revit to use the unique ids you need, but you can easily equip the building elements with the pre-existing ids in your own data structure and replace them in the IFC file or elsewhere along the processing pipeline.\nBe creative.\n\nThere is already an existing mechanism for keeping IFC GUID's consistent for elements between IFC exports from a Revit project, described in the thread on [GUID](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/guid/m-p/10616955) (cf. [below](#5).\n\nIf you need to recreate the elements in Revit, then you need to repopulate the parameter used to store the GUID in relation to the above setting with the value you want it to be.\n\nSo, if you are creating elements in Revit from data in this external database, then just populate the parameter of that created element with what exists in your external database (removing same superseded item in Revit).\nThen, when exported, the IFC GUID will be generated from the parameter if the above setting is used for export."

This is what I was looking for!\n\nMany thanks (again and again) to Richard for sharing his inexhaustible experience and providing so many great solutions!\n\nBy the way, this was also explained by The Building Coder in 2015,\non [accessing the IFC GUID of an imported wall](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/ifc-guid-access-life-span-and-cloning-of-geometry.html#3)."
