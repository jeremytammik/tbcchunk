    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Access Permission to Load my First Add-In\n\nI probably pointed beginners to\nthe [Revit API getting started material](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2) several\nthousand times already, and sincerely hope that it provides a couple of useful pointers for them.\n\nStill, people keep running into problems anyway.\n\nA colleague hit another unexpected obstacle last week:\n\n**Question:** I dived into the Getting Started with Revit platform API, following the DevTV tutorial by Augusto Goncalves.\nNone of my commands appear on the Revit UI &gt; Add Ins &gt; external commands. \n\n**Answer:** One thing you ought to read is the introductory section of\nthe [Revit API developers guide](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2022/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_html).\nIt tells you exactly what to do to install and launch your add-in.\nIt is shocking if that information is not clear and does not work in the tutorial, though.\nThank you for bringing it up!\n\nInstalling a Revit add-in is really simple, but people run into difficulties like you describe anyway.\n  \nThere are only two relevant components:\n \n- Add-in manifest file `*.addin`\n- .NET class library assembly `DLL`\n \nThese are the important steps:\n \n- The DLL must implement `IExternalCommand`; that means, it must implement the `Execute` method.\n- The add-in manifest must point to the DLL and must be placed in the Revit Add-Ins folder for Revit to find and load it.\n- If the DLL and add-in manifest both reside in the Revit `AddIns` folder, the full DLL path can be omitted; otherwise it must be specified.\n \nThat is really all.\n \nThere are thousands of places explaining it; they all say the same thing.\n \nGood luck and lots of fun with the Revit API :-)\n\n**Response:** I have not had any luck since yesterday about my add-in not appearing in the Revit external commands.\n\nI have carefully structured my code correctly.\nThe add-in manifest file is pointing to my project `.dll` file.\nMy project class explicitly implements the `IExternalCommand` interface and fires up the `Execute` method just fine.\nI don't understand what the issue could be.\n\n**Update:** I managed to debug my code.\nKindly, ignore previous message. \n\nThe location of my manifest add-in file was locked.\nI guess that happened when my account was set up.\nThe location needed permission to be accessed.\nThis path: \n\n- C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2022\\\n\nI utilised the try and catch exception to see the issue.\n\nOnce I gave access permission, the add-in file is now visible; it worked!\n\n####<a name=\"2.2\"></a> Assembly Path and Buttons Missing\n\nAnother issue getting started was resolved by decompiling and analysing the add-in .NET assembly DLL using IL decompilers, \n[\"Failed to initialize the <i>add_in_name</i> because the assembly <i>path_to_an_add_in_DLL_file</i> does not exist\" when launching Revit](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70887489/failed-to-initialize-the-add-in-name-because-the-assembly-path-to-an-add-in):\n\n**Question:** I've exhausted every resource possible and can not figure out what the issue is.\nButton images won't show and I keep getting this message launching Revit when I try to use the command:\n\n> Failed to initialize the [add-in name] because the assembly [path to an add-in DLL file] does not exist\n\nBut I may have been trying to run before I learned to walk with this one.\nThe only thing I'm not understanding is why the commands work fine in the addins but the buttons can't find them.\n\n**Answer:** Maybe your add-in is trying to reference a .NET assembly DLL that cannot be found when Revit tries to load it.\nLooking at the list of namespaces that you reference in your source code `using` statements, I see nothing but standard Autodesk Revit, Microsoft and .NET assemblies listed.\nSo, they should all be present and accessible.\nAre you using anything else elsewhere in your code that is not obvious from that list?\nYou might be able to use tools like `fuslogv` to analyse your add-in dependencies during load time, as suggested in the note\non [exploring assembly reference DLL hell with Fuslogvw](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2021/05/revitlookup-update-fuslogvw-and-override-joins.html#6).\n\n**Response:** Looks like I'm getting some XAML Binding errors during debug.\n\nUpdate: I got one of the buttons to work correctly after I put the full path for the assemblies:\n\n- <i>C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2021\\TpMechanical\\bin\\Debug\\TpMechanical.dll</i>\n\nUpdate 2: The IL decompiler did the trick!\nThe full class name was pulling as a different name.\nNow I just have to figure out the button images and I'll be in a good spot to start on my own plugins. \n\nUpdate 3: Just solved my image issue.\nI changed the resources to embed and used the full path to the resources.\nSeems to have done the trick."
