Each of these are individual elements in the Revit model. For end users, though, all of these comprise of a single Panel.</p><p>I need to align this panel (including all the pieces) using the Align post command in one command – meaning I cannot ask users to select top cap, align, then select tile, align, etc.</p><p>The Align post command works with one element at a time and does not support window select. Even if we had all the top cap, end cap, tiles, frames, etc. of this panel selected in one click, on Align command launch, it deselects all the selection and prompts users to select reference plane/line and then each individual element.</p><p>Is there any way to align all the selected elements that comprise of a panel in single align command?  I was thinking of grouping these together before align, and after align finishes, ungrouping them – but since this is done using post commands, it will group, ungroup and then call post command at the end.</p><p>How might I achieve this programmatically?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> You could group the elements, post the command, and then use an updater to ungroup, I suppose.</p><p>If the user never created the alignment the updater would not be called, that makes this a bit tricky to manage.</p><a name=\"5\"></a>"

If you mean a process of which result is a rendered image of a 3D view, like if the Render command in Revit is used, then the answer is 'No' – the Custom Exporter cannot do that. What the Custom Exporter does is hand over all graphic entities visible in a 3D view to the API caller who invoked the Custom Exporter Execute method. It is up to the caller to decide what to do with the information. They can use it to produce a file (e.g. SVG, WebGL, PDF, etc.) or use it to create an image, assuming they have access to some custom render engine. </p><a name=\"6\"></a>"

It does have limitations on how it can be interacted with.</li>\n<li>The DirectShape element introduced in Revit 2015 – this can be any desired 3D shape, with any material.  This is saved with the document so the developer would need to manage its lifetime if they don't want it saved.</li>\n</ol>\n<a name=\"7\"></a>\n<h4>Berlin Hackathon Beginning</h4>\n<p>Back to here and now, the Berlin hackathon just started, with the hashtag\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tmuhack\">#TMUHack</a>.\n\nHere are Peter Schlipf and Cyrille Fauvel presenting once again on the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.46\">\nAutodesk View and Data API</a>:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Peter Schlipf at TMUHack\" src=\"file:////j/photo/jeremy/2014/2014-10-25_berlin_hackathon/616_peter_schlipf_tmuhack_cropped.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Here are some of the ideas being worked on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthias – text api work cloud, upload article, generate work cloud banner on top of article, click on it to get more info.</li>\n<li>Pawan, india – shopping last minute delivery crowd shipping, people collaborate for shopping, shop for each other.</li>\n<li>Achim – financial services, reinvent banking, real-time, mobile, account statement, plus predictive analysis.</li>\n<li>Jan, keyrocket – with stephan, text api.</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Movie memory game – summaries of movies, match with movie cover, multiplayer game, one card is dvd cover, the other is data extracted from the summary.</li>\n<li>Style guide – style guide, trawler, random web sites, get all style elements and eliminate less used styles.</li>\n</ol>\n<li>Stephen – text api plus autodesk, datascapes, human interaction, compare real-time data for user, they need a service or product, pull info from internet and generate profile.</li>\n<li>Alex – quiz generator, test learning, editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm working with the <a href=\"http://m3my.github.io\">MovieMemory</a> team...</p></p>"
