Thank you very much! Added to bookmarks.\n\nCan we get the name of the button, its description, or some kind of indicator after clicking it?\n\nFor example, I created one class MyCommand : IExternalCommand and registered it for several \"PushButtonData\" (\"MyButtonOne\", \"MyButtonTwo\").\nAfter clicking on the button both times through the debugger, I will get to the same Execute() method of the MyCommand class.\nIn this case, is it possible to determine which of the buttons called this method?\nAny way at all, even the most perverted...\n\n**Answer:**\nYou can do it with some step like this:\n\n- Add assembly reference `AdWindows.dll`\n- Add the event tracking user click on the button at `IExternalApplication` below\n- Call the action from external command matching the id returned from the event clicked\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-cs\">using AW = Autodesk.Windows;\n\nAutodesk.Windows.ComponentManager.UIElementActivated\n  += RibbonUtils.ComponentManagerOnUIElementActivated;\n\npublic static void ComponentManagerOnUIElementActivated(\n  object sender,\n  AW.UIElementActivatedEventArgs e)\n{\n  try\n  {\n    var id = e.Item.Id;\n    // match with id string contents here and save\n    // after that match with all commands in your plugin\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n**Response:**\nThank you so much for the prompt response!\nI think this is exactly what I need!\n\nMany thanks to Chuong Ho for the comprehensive solution."
