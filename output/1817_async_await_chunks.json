    "chunk_text": "### External Communication and Async Await Event\n\nThe question of communicating from outside with Revit is popping up with increasing frequency.\n\nSince Revit is designed as an interactive end user tool, misusing it as a server may fail and may also violate the license agreement.\n\nTherefore, in many cases, the cleanest (or only clean) solution will involve use of\nthe [Forge Design Automation API for Revit](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview)\nor [DA4R](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55).\n\nHowever, it is also possible to make use of Revit as a server in a limited way via\nan [external event](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/05089477-4612-35b2-81a2-89c4f44370ea.htm).\n\nMany aspects of this have been discussed numerous times in the past in the topic group\non [external events for modeless access and driving Revit from outside](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28).\n\nHowever, people sometimes prefer not to read and research, not to fish, but rather ask repeated questions and be fed, so we return to this topic again (and again).\n\nFurthermore, our new hero Igor shared a cool wrapper for external events that makes the process easier than ever before:\n\n- [`async` and `await` external event wrapper](#2)\n- [Communicating with another process](#3)\n- [Autodesk open positions](#4)\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/communication.png\" alt=\"Communication\" title=\"Communication\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center>"

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>Communicating with Another Process\n\nThe issue of communicating with another process was also discussed back and forth a couple of times in the past few days in \nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\non [Revit add-in communicating with other process](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-addin-communicating-with-other-process/m-p/9275981):\n\n**Question:** I need to write a Revit add-in (the external command) which listens to messages from other process (not from Revit itself).\nIn other words, the Revit add-in would be the server, another process would be a client.\n\nI tried to use async pipe to communicate with other process but the Revit add-in doesn't listen to any messages.\n\nI think it's because of my server-side pipe in Revit is closed as soon as the `Execute` method returns and terminates.\n\nIs there any way to keep the server pipe still alive, even after the add-in's `Execute` finishes?\n\nI think I should create a thread in Execute to resolve this issue. Is this approach feasible?\n\nI would really appreciate any example code.\n\n**Answer:** Yes. Thank you for the relevant and interesting question.\n\nThe recommended approach is to implement and use an external event for this.\n\nThe external event SDK sample illustrates:\n\n- SDK/Samples/ModelessDialog/ModelessForm_ExternalEvent/\n\nMany related discussions and solutions are listed by The Building Coder\non [External Events for Modeless Access and Driving Revit from Outside](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28).\n\nAlso check out some more recent discussions on using IPC:\n\n- [Set Floor Level and Use IPC for Disentanglement](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/set-floor-level-and-use-ipc-for-disentanglement.html)\n- [Scaling an Add-In for a 4K High Resolution Screen](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/09/scaling-an-add-in-for-a-4k-high-resolution-screen.html)\n- [Integrating a Web-Based UI](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/09/ui-top-forms-buttons-web-etc.html#4)\n- [Integrating the Helix 3D Viewer with a WPF Add-In](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/11/integrating-the-helix-3d-viewer-with-a-wpf-add-in.html)\n\n**Response:** I really appreciate your prompt answer.\n\nI'm curious about the entry point.\nThe only way I know in order to load my customized code is by implementing an external command,\nYou said to forget about external command.\nDoes Revit have any other interfaces to import customised code?\n\n**Answer:** Yes.\n\nThe Revit API is completely event driven.\n\nMany (or most? or all?) of the Revit events provide a valid Revit API context.\n\nLook at the [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Events namespace](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/b86712d6-83b3-e044-8016-f9881ecd3800.htm).\n\n**Response:** I have one more question.\n\nFrom the first link you gave me on using IPC for disentanglement, I found an example code *IPC_test_revit_plugin.zip*.\n\nIt includes a browser project and a Revit add-in project.\nIs this add-in (external command) able to listen for messages from other applications until Revit is terminated?\n\n**Answer:** An external command listens to one message only, and nothing else.\n\nThe only message an external command is ever interested in is the `Execute` message that it implements a handler for.\n\nThe only instance that can send that message is Revit.exe.\n\nThe only time the message is sent is when Revit.exe wishes the external command to be executed.\n\n**Response:** I want to develop an add-in that can be loaded in Revit that listens to messages from another process (application) as long as Revit is running. Is it possible to implement?\n\n**Answewr:** Yes, using an [external event](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28).\n\nHowever, Revit is not designed for that purpose and you may violate the license agreement by doing so.\n\nFor that purpose,\na [DA4R application](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55) may\nbe a more appropriate choice:"
