    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"7\"></a>Athens Forge Workshop\n\nA workshop on how to set up a Node.js web server and client-side JavaScript code to display and interact with CAD models from over 50 different source file formats, based on open source WebGL and Three.js technology.\n\nThe API allows developers to create interactive websites for all kinds of different markets where 3D interaction could be added.\n\nThe web world has changed. Now that all the most popular web browsers support WebGL, 3D on the web is a reality. With this workshop, JS and 3D enthusiasts can learn to create interactive web application and also get a head start on VR apps.\n\nWe share our knowledge using WebGL and Three.js technology based on two APIs and guide attendees through the entire process of building a simple application, including writing a node.js web server, use of npm, hosting the web application and interacting with the 3D model by running different viewer JS extensions.\n\nFirst, using the REST API, we set up the Node.js server, enabling you to upload and translate 2D/3D models into a light-weight format for downloading and displaying on the client side. \n\nThe second part is a client-side JS API that allows you to embed, customize through JS extensions and automate an interactive 2D and 3D model viewer on your web page. We can also investigate the use of a Web IDE that allows us to host our created Github repos, run a dedicated NPM and host our 3D website in the Cloud. \n\nThe intended audience for this workshop is JS and 3D enthusiasts with the desire to take their web apps to the next level and create attractive and eye-candy apps with a head start to the design of their own VR apps.\n\nThe workshop enables you to:\n\n- View 2D and 3D models in any browser or device without installing any plug-in or additional software. \n- Create and run a Node.js application. \n- Host your 3D website using 3rd party Web IDE. \n- Use the Extension API in the WebGL viewer to interact with the 2D and 3D models. \n- Identify resources for learning more about the technology."
