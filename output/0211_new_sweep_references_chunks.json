I have also tried building the Reference array using code like this without any luck:\n\n<pre>\nrefArray.Append(curve.get_EndPointReference(0))\nrefArray.Append(curve.get_EndPointReference(1))\n</pre>\n<p>Any help you can provide that allows me to sweep along a 3D path would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>\nNewSweep is used in the family document to create a new sweep.\nThe overloads you refer to for creating a new sweep form are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NewSweep( Boolean, ReferenceArray, SweepProfile, Int32, ProfilePlaneLocation ), using an array of selected references as a 3D path.\n<li>NewSweep( Boolean, CurveArray, SketchPlane, SweepProfile, Int32, ProfilePlaneLocation ), using a path of curve elements. \n</li></li></ul>\n<p>The three last arguments are the same for both overloads, so these are presumably not cause of the problem:\n\n<ul>\n<li>SweepProfile profile,\n<li>int profileLocationCurveIndex, and \n<li>ProfilePlaneLocation profilePlaneLocation.\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>The API documentation specifies the reference array passed in to define the path in the first overload as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ReferenceArray path: \nThe path of the sweep. \nThe path should be reference of curve or edge obtained from existing geometry.\n</li></ul>\n<p>The cause of your problem is almost certainly the fact that the curve that you are trying to obtain references from is not part of any existing geometry, since you created it on the fly.\n\n<p>To understand the difference and the importance of this, here are some private hypothetical musings of mine on what references actually mean within Revit.\nI have never seen any hard documentation of this, but I am gradually getting the following idea:</p>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<p>All of objects living in the Revit API Geometry namespace are transient in-memory objects.\nThe non-transient Revit BIM model resides in the database.\nTo query the geometry of BIM objects, transient geometry is generated on the fly from their parametric representations.\nIf a new BIM object B is to be generated and stored in the database, such as your sweep, and it needs to reference existing BIM geometry in any way, for instance some edge of an existing object A, then a reference can be generated to provide a hook from the new object B definition through the transient geometry back to the underlying BIM object A.\nLater on, when the BIM is saved, the transient geometry has all disappeared, but the reference ensures that B knows that it depends on the geometry and location of A in some way.\nIf A is moved or modified, B can adapt.\n\n<p>In your sample, you are creating a new line between two fixed points pt1 and pt2.\nThis is all transient geometry, and not referring back to any BIM object, so there is no way that the resulting curve can contain or provide a valid reference to anything.\n\n<p>The question is why you are trying to use the overload requiring a reference array at all?\nIf your input data is fixed, you should use the curve array option instead.\n\n<p>By the way, for completeness sake, prompted by your query, I had a look at the VSTA family samples.\nThey are provided in the Revit SDK VSTA Samples sub-folder, in the family file Revit_VSTA_Family_Samples.rfa.\nI see the code you based yours on, in the subroutine CreateSweep() of the GenericModelCreation project.\nThis project is also provided as one of the standard SDK samples as well, albeit only in a C# version.</p>\n<p>I hope this answers your question. Good luck!\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
