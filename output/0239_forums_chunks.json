\nI would really like to work with someone for a day or two. \nAgain, I'm learning C# programming and I feel adding source code and code regions are probably pretty easy to do once I gain a better understanding of the basics.\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The short answer is no, sorry. \nI'm in Switzerland, in Europe. \nSome of the people I talk with may or may not be in your area, but I really don't know. \n\n<p>I completely agree with your assessment that it is not hard to make use of the API once you have gone through the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/getting_started\">\ngetting started</a>\n\nmaterial. \nStill, for more complex issues, a bit of professional guidance can be invaluable.\n\n<p>You might be able to find someone in the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/partnerproducts\">\nADN member database</a>.\n\nOr you might post a query to the Revit API discussion group under \n\n<a href=\"http://discussion.autodesk.com\">\nhttp://discussion.autodesk.com</a> &gt; Revit Architecture &gt; Revit API,\n\nor to \n\n<a href=\"http://forums.augi.com\">\nAUGI</a>,\n\neither in a specific forum e.g. under \n\n<a href=\"http://forums.augi.com/forumdisplay.php?f=93\">Revit</a> or the \n\n<a href=\"http://forums.augi.com/forumdisplay.php?f=218\">Revit API</a>,\n\nor possibly searching the AUGI web site globally for Los Angeles or something.\n\n<h4>Autodesk Developer Network</h4>\n<p>At this point, I should not forget to mention my real work, which is providing developer support as part of the AEC workgroup of the DevTech team for ADN, the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn\">\nAutodesk Developer Network</a>.\n\nThe Autodesk Developer Network is a program providing professional support to programmers writing add-in applications for Autodesk software. \nOne advantage of being an ADN member is that you can ask question on the Autodesk APIs and are guaranteed an answer within a certain time span, three days for standard and 24 hours for professional members.\n\nHere are some other of the program benefits:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Access to almost all Autodesk software and SDKs, including early access to Beta software\n<li>Members-only website with thousands of technical articles\n<li>Unlimited technical support\n<li>Product direction through conferences\n<li>Marketing benefits\n<li>Exposure on autodesk.com\n<li>Promotional opportunities \n<li>1 to 3 free API training classes\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>You dont have to be a commercial software developer to join ADN.\n\n<p>And there is yet another level of even higher guidance available: if your needs go beyond simple generic support for the standard Autodesk APIs, you can also ask ADN or the Autodesk Consulting group for mentoring or custom development services.\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
