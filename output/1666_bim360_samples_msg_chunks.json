    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a> The Real Message\n\nThe real message about Forge for AEC and BIM360, according to Jim Quanci, with whom I luckily was able to chat yesterday, is this:\n\n- A number of people work on the project team, in a BIM360 project: managers, plumbers, projects superintendents, etc., on both desktop and mobile.\n- The rest of the organisation, a much larger number of people, does not work in that (rather complex, specialised) environment.\n- The organisation can save cost and time by letting everybody concerned always see what is going on in each project.\n- A majority of the collaborators do not need or want the full BIM360.\n- Using Forge, you can easily pop up your own web page to provide them with whatever information they need.\n\nI explained this principle in more depth in my presentation\non [rational BIM programming](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/10/rational-bim-programming-at-au-darmstadt.html) at\nAutodesk University in Darmstadt, Germany, last year.\n\nOne of the main motivating aspects in that talk is basically exactly what Jim points out:"

It keeps changing all the time &mdash; the principles remain the same.\n\nIn extreme cases, these numbers might vary by several orders of magnitude:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/bim_collaboration_roles_magnitude.png\" alt=\"BIM Collaboration Roles and Magnitudes\" width=\"360\"/>\n</center>\n\nFor more details, please refer\nto [my presentation mentioned above](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/10/rational-bim-programming-at-au-darmstadt.html)."
