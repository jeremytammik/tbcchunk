    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Problem\n\nIt started off with the following question in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) thread\non [Revit 2016 SDK macro samples obsolete](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/revit-2016-sdk-macro-samples-obsolete/m-p/6518413):\n\n**Question:** In reviewing the SDK documentation and various web-based Autodesk help resources, I have yet to find a resolution to this issue. The sample Revit project located in the Revit 2016 SDK 'Macro Samples\\Revit_Macro_Samples.rvt' project appears to be a Revit 2013 project. After opening and upgrading the document for use in Revit 2016, I attempted to run a macro. The macro manager shows that there are problems with the macros:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/macro-manager.png\" alt=\"Macro manager problems\" width=\"476\">\n</center>\n\nUpon editing and attempting to build, [debug output indicates many critical errors, cf. build.txt](zip/macro_build.txt), which appear to result from various class methods that have been deprecated somewhere between Revit 2013 and Revit 2016.\n \nIs there a functional macro sample Revit project available somewhere? Am I approaching this incorrectly, somehow? The Autodesk help makes multiple mentions of the necessity to upgrade, and sometimes manually edit the macros so that they will function. However, implementing the deprecated methods according to the 2016 API would require significant changes, time, and effort.\n \nIs it better to ignore this sample document and use some other web resources for learning the foundations of Revit macro creation? Are there good resources for Python-based macro development? It appears that newly created Python macros are automagically populated with sample macros that can be successfully built. However, creation of new C# and VB.Net do NOT offer similar buildable samples.\n \nI'm incredibly confused by the SDK and various documentation inconsistencies, and various web searches do not offer any solutions. Thanks in advance for any insights.\n\n**Answer:** Thank you for your report and very sorry about your confusion.\n \nI hope that the material for [getting started with the Revit API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2) in its non-macro incarnation is a bit clearer.\n \nThe macro environment should be simpler to use. I am sorry to hear that the samples are broken, though.\n \nI checked, and we do indeed have an existing change request number **REVIT-93253** *SDK macro samples cause build errors due to obsolete API* for this issue.\n \nI hope this trouble getting started with the Revit macros does not put you off and that you find a good, fruitful, productive and fun way forward with no further frustrations."
