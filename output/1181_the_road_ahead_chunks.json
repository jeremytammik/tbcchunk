This is the basis of a huge shift in customer expectations, behaviors – and business growth opportunity.  If you only sell desktop software, your market is shrinking.  It's very very hard to grow your business when the market you sell into is shrinking.</p><p>Gartner: Android is clearly the dominant OS of our time.  Sure lots are mobile devices – but we are approaching the point where revenue from mobile devices (including tablets) is larger then PC sales.  And a lot more profitable too.  Do you have android development skills?  What are you waiting for?  As a side note, OS sales by Apple will exceed OS sales by Microsoft this year (driven by mobile – phones and tablets).</p><p>Hard to believe, but this is all still driven by the now 20 year old shift from client and client server computing to the internet – its shock waves are still driving rapid change and growth opportunities today.</p><p>It's all about the shift of individuals working alone to physically distributed and often \"ad hoc\" teams quickly forming, working and dispersing.  This is not simple networking sharing of files – but true real time collaboration – a shift that is still just getting started in the B2B world.</p><p>Anyone here use Google Docs?  Have you experienced real time collaboration without the hassles and complexity of file based revision control?  It's what the university students use – as well as many young start-ups.</p><p>The rapid change in how we pay for things – from cash and checks to electronic.  Do you take on-line payments?</p>"

    "chunk_text": "<h4>Platforms and Technologies</h4><p>Do you do development with the high growth OS's?  iOS is as large as Windows, and Linux and Android are used by many more people.</p><p>Note two of the three high growth OS's are open source.  Autodesk is just now finishing moving all our servers to Linux based stacks – off of Windows – saving Autodesk tens of millions of dollars per year.  Do you still use Windows servers?  Why is that?</p><p>What development technologies do you and your team use?  No, C++ is not going away – but a lot more development is happening on web and mobile technologies then C++.  Are most of your staff doing C++ or C# work?  Why?  Developing with these tools is slow – taking weeks, months and years.  The web and mobile technologies allow development in hours, days and weeks.  Who go slow?  Sure you need some C++ development – but most of your development needs to move on to more flexible and more productive technologies.  Notice all of these are public standards – and not proprietary technology.</p><p>Is Visual Studio your primary development tool?  It's likely you or your team are being held back by fear of using new development tools.  Note 2 of the 3 modern development environments are open source.</p><p>What are you using for source code control?  Most companies Autodesk is now acquiring use freely available cloud based GitHub – making for easy distributed real time collaboration – and easy sharing with others – such as how ADN is now making all code samples available through GitHub.  And It's making our code samples better.</p><p>How do you get support?  Is it through formal partnering programs – or social networks of various sorts?  Is it about \"submitting cases\" and waiting days for an answer or searching Forums and Blogs and other web sites?</p><p>Are you or your team familiar with the new high performance high throughput \"NoSQL\" databases?  They are mostly open source too.</p><p>Are you or your team familiar with the new web/mobile UI development tools – or are you still using difficult and slow to use Windows tools?</p><p>Do you have performance problems?  Are you using grid (massively parallel) computing readily enabled on the Cloud?  You need to get hadoop expertise when you do (versus old expensive proprietary technologies).  Does anyone on your team even know when hadoop can solve a performance problem you have?</p>"

Are you ready?</p><p>The growth opportunity is huge... move from 10-15 million to 200-400 million... it's about increasing the size of your business by 2X, 3X, 4X or more.  The number of users you can address with the new web/mobile technologies is huge.
