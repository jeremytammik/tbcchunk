It offers better performance, compatibility, and support compared to the previously used CefSharp. This ensures consistent rendering across all Windows devices, improved security, and the ability to use the latest web technologies.\n  What does this mean for you?\n  The transition to WebView2 is designed to be as seamless as possible. However, as with any significant change, there may be minor adjustments. We kindly ask you to test if all the existing features work fine as usual.\n  How can you help?\n  Please spend some time using Revit as you normally would, and pay particular attention to any features that use web content. If you encounter any issues or notice any changes in functionality, we would greatly appreciate your feedback.\n  We thank you in advance for testing this enhancement!\n\n- Twentytwo\n  a place for BIM Programming enthusiasts\n  WRITTEN BY MIN.NAUNG\n  i mentioned\n  TwentyTwo Add-Ins and Tutorials\n  https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/10/element-level-and-ifc-properties-.html#2\n  Now they have also started a blog with high quality Revit API articles\n  REVIT API : SCHEDULE CREATION\n  https://twentytwo.space/2021/05/02/revit-api-schedule-creation/\n  REVIT API SERIES\n  https://twentytwo.space/revit-api-series/\n  helped solve recent question\n  on [Sort/Grouping field in schedule]\n  https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/sort-grouping-field-in-schedule/m-p/12869665\n\n- ugrep\n  https://ugrep.com\n  https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep\n  ug --filter='pdf:pdftotext % -' -i jeremy *pdf\n  the ug+ command is the same as the ug command, but also uses filters to search PDFs, documents, and image metadata\n  built-in filters ug+ -i jeremy *pdf\n  fuzzy search ug+ -Z -i jeremmy *pdf\n\n- AI just figured out Meshes\n  https://youtu.be/rQolOT4tuUY\n  original paper: MeshAnything: Artist-Created Mesh Generation with Autoregressive Transformers -- https://huggingface.co/papers/2406.10163\n  demo: MeshAnything: Artist-Created Mesh Generation with Autoregressive Transformers -- https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yiwen-ntu/MeshAnything\n  code: GitHub https://github.com/buaacyw/MeshAnything\n  course: Welcome to the ðŸ¤— Machine Learning for 3D Course -- https://huggingface.co/learn/ml-for-3d-course/unit0/introduction\n\n- Claude Sonnet Selfreflects\n  Claude Sonnet 3.5 Passes the AI Mirror Test\n  https://x.com/joshwhiton/status/1806000237728931910\n  claude_sonnet_selfreflect.jpg\n\n- Artificial Intelligence Is Stupid and Causal Reasoning Will Not Fix It\n  https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.513474/full\n  Mark Bishop, \"Deep Stupidity: A Provocation on the Things LLMs Can and Cannot Do.\"\n  https://youtu.be/sN-vsd7SVqs\n\n- Researchers upend AI status quo by eliminating matrix multiplication in LLMs\n  https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/researchers-upend-ai-status-quo-by-eliminating-matrix-multiplication-in-llms/\n\ntwitter:\n\n @AutodeskRevit #RevitAPI #BIM @DynamoBIM\n\n&ndash; ...\n\nlinkedin:\n\n#BIM #DynamoBIM #AutodeskAPS #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n-->"

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Personalised Material Asset Properties\n\nJacob Small provided a useful and succinct summary of info to help answer how\nto [create a custom material asset](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/create-a-custom-material-asset/m-p/12700408):\n\n**Question:**\nI would like to know if it is possible to create a personalised material asset with personalised properties that can be displayed in the Material Browser. For example, a material asset called \"Test\" placed after \"Thermal\". And in \"Test\" put a property like \"Address\".\nIf this isn't possible, is it possible to add the \"Address\" property to an asset that already exists, for example \"Identity\"?\nIf so, can we then create a new section in the Identity asset as \"Additional information\"?\n\n**Answer:**\nSome quick 'info' on what I think I know about material assets:\n\nThe only \"asset types\" in the UI are Appearance, Thermal, and Physical. In the API these are called Appearance, Thermal, and Structural (because why would they match?). I'll be using the API names going forward because we're in that forum (perhaps someone curious can ask about the UI stuff in the other forum).\n\nThe Thermal and Structural asset types can be deleted from a material in the UI and set as an invalid Element Id in the API. The Appearance asset cannot.\n\nThe other tabs in the material editor are collections of properties and parameters of the material element itself, not a linked asset - but are masquerading as an asset due to how they are presented in the UI.  For example to get the name (shows in the identity tab) you get the Name property of a material element. To get the foreground surface pattern (shows in the graphics tab) you'd get the SurfaceForegroundPatternId property. To set the Comments in the Identity tab you'd use a Set method on the comment parameter.\n\nThe only thing unavailable is the keywords (noted as missing in 2019 and as far as I know still unavailable).\n\nSo the question becomes, how can you accomplish what you're after?\n\nYou could map a property from the identity tab (URL looks like an option) to an extensible storage object with the data you need; however users won't be able to edit it in the material editor. Personally I would make 'non-UserModifiable' parameters on the materials category, and associate them to the materials in your template, and let them be edited/reviewed via an add-in which would also allow updating the rest of the assets. This add-in could also ensure that materials added via your tool would have these hidden parameters quickly set when materials from your library (a sub-component of your add-in) are added to the model.\n\nIt'd be a big lift but likely one which would benefit many beyond your company.\n\nMany thanks to Jacob for this helpful summary."
