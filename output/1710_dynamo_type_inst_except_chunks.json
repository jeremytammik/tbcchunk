So, clarifying the different possibilities provided by these APIs would be useful.\nMaybe a comparison matrix will help?\n\n**Answer:** The Revit API is pretty clear, isn't it?\n \nIt is the one and only API for Revit.\n \nDynamo makes use of it, and you can use all of it.\n \nSo, Dynamo is a layer over the Revit API, and you can use all of the Revit API from Dynamo.\n \nDynamo also includes other functionality, e.g., DesignScript and its own geometry library.\n \nSo, in some areas, you can do more in Dynamo than in the native Revit API.\n \nHowever, for manipulating RVT files, Dynamo has nothing more to offer than what is provided by the Revit API.\n \nFor architects, Dynamo seems to be the more effective path, cf., e.g., this compelling suggestion\nto [learn dynamo](https://vasshaug.net/2015/09/18/learn-dynamo).\n \nThe [Dynamo Primer slide deck](zip/dynamo_primer.pdf)\nby [Paolo Emilio Serra](https://twitter.com/PaoloESerra),\nAutodesk Implementation Consultant and author of\nthe [Punto Revit blog](http://puntorevit.blogspot.com),\nincludes some references to the Revit API and how to access it via Python Script.\nFor more details, please refer to his own presentation of\nhis [Dynamo Primer Slide Deck](https://puntorevit.blogspot.com/2018/12/dynamo-primer-slide-deck.html).\n\n<!--- https://wiki.autodesk.com/download/attachments/487396126/Dynamo%20Primer.pptx?version=1&modificationDate=1544112611952&api=v2 --->\n \nAs said, from an API standpoint, Dynamo objects are wrappers around Revit objects, there are some 'shortcuts' to convert parameter values to match the Display Unit Types, or alternative syntax to manage transactions etc. but there is nothing out of this world. The good idea behind Dynamo for Revit, with the full user interface, is that it has a serialization/binding feature with Revit elements for free, so it’s like adding intelligence to your Revit model rather than mere automation of tasks you can achieve with traditional programming.\nFor an end user not accustomed to coding, it is much easier to set a value using the units they are using in the project rather than\n \nThe visual programming approach is different, the way Dynamo handles namespaces, inheritance and polymorphism defines how to read the find the nodes in the library.\nThe way a function is called multiple times on a list of inputs, the lacing strategy, replication guides, etc.. are concepts that belong to visual programming and don’t even find a good parallel in a traditional coding language sometimes.\n \nNot all the Revit API calls are converted into nodes (i.e. the MEP objects are completely missing and customers complained a lot, but in those cases you just use the Revit API.\nPeople started to create Dynamo packages to expand the out of the box functionalities.\nFor example, for the Forge users, there is a package called DynaWeb that enables REST API calls from Dynamo… It was developed wrapping the System.Net objects into Dynamo nodes and the end users can use them in a visual programming context.\nThe dependencies are still a pain to manage and the 'graphs' (read the Dynamo code) cannot be compiled into an unmodifiable .DLL, with risks, IP concerns etc..\nEven so, Dynamo is really popular because, as Rob Todd once said, it 'commoditizes programming', and it enables our customer to do more, with better results with less effort.\n\nFor Dynamo scalability, also COM and .NET can be included, as they can be used via Python scripting (it’s in fact IronPython that supports managed .DLLs for example).\n\nFor example, one developer wrote an extensive library in C# for Dynamo that uses multiple frameworks at the same time such as COM for Civil 3D and .NET for Revit.\n\nAnother impressive example of interoperability between the different .NET languages is provided by \nthe [Python code external command loader and compiler implemented in F#](https://tailoryourbim.com/2018/11/10/efficiently-at-compiling-python-code-as-external-command-%E8%A3%9D%E8%BC%89-python-%E7%B7%A8%E7%A2%BC%E6%88%90-revit-%E5%A4%96%E9%83%A8%E7%A8%8B%E5%BC%8F) shared by [tailoryourbim](https://tailoryourbim.com).\nI have repeatedly pointed out that the Revit API can be used from any .NET supporting language.\n[Ching](https://tailoryourbim.com/about) shows how this can be taken to extremes by implementing an external command in F#\nthat loads and compiles an external command implemented in Python.\nIn his own words, he 'wrote a simple Python code loader in F#, which loads a Python script into Revit as an external command, combining with [IronPython](http://ironpython.net).'\n\nIn fact, macro and add-in functionality is identical in all respects, I would say.\nYou can probably find an exception to that statement, but it would probably be something rather obscure.\n\nBoth VS and SharpDevelop support C#, VB, Ruby and Python. Probably, IronRuby and IronPython for VS need optional installation.\nSharpDevelop installs Ruby and Python as default while Revit installation:\n \n<center>\n<img src=\"img/sharpdevelop_cs_vb_rb_py.png\" alt=\"SharpDevelop IDE supports C#, VB, Ruby and Python\" width=\"579\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">SharpDevelop IDE supports C#, VB, Ruby and Python</p>\n</center>\n\nYou might also want to check out the [FAQ in the Revit online help](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_FAQ_html),\nwhich says:\n\n> <u>What languages are supported for Revit API development?</u>\n\n> C#, VB.NET, and C++/CLI are supported for addin development. C#, VB.NET, IronPython, and IronRuby are supported for macro development. Other CLR languages may work with the Revit API, but they are untested and unsupported. Note that for mixed managed/native applications using C++, Revit uses the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, specifically, version 14.0.23026.0. Add-ins compiled with other versions of the VC runtime may not work correctly since the Revit install does not include any other VC runtimes.\n \nI'm not sure this FAQ is completely accurate and up to date, though."

We have some conflicting opinions in our department and I am looking at getting some \"good\" \"professional\" concrete advice.\n\nOne of the guys here has been putting together some dynamo scripts using 2.0 and now upgraded to 2.0.1.  We are running Revit 2019.1 for the most part.  Autodesk however packages 1.3.3 (?) with their 2019 software releases.\n\nFor scripts we release to production/end users to use, would you recommend we stick with 1.3.3 or develop in 2.0.X.  From what I understand 2.0 is a pretty big overhaul of dynamo and it's node packages.  So, I am aware of the upgrading and compatibility issues with trying to write scripts in 1.3.3 vs 2.0.  Pretty much have to re-write them.  However, with the stability of 2.0 up in the air, there is some hesitation to move forward with this.  What are some thoughts out there on the subject?  Is there \"real\" definite reasons on why a person would or would not want to use 2.0.X or 1.3.3 ?\n\n**Answer:** 1.3.3 is the latest version that was shipped with a point release of Revit, and 1.3.4 is in the pipeline for the next update release.\n\nUsers and offices who are comfortable going ahead of the Revit shipping product can access both 1.3.4 and 2.0.2 currently on the Latest stable release download pages:\n\n- [dynamobuilds.com](http://dynamobuilds.com)\n- [dynamobim.org/download](http://dynamobim.org/download)\n\nAs far as why they would upgrade and what the impact is, Dynamo 2.0 does represent an upgrade process for 1.x scripts, and does have enhancements to what is offered. The bigger feature items are:\n\n- Python improvements\n- List management improvements (Dictionaries)\n- Library browser UX\n- A collection of new nodal functionality\n- The ability to load Extensions from the Package Manager (an even more powerful manner of exchanging functionality)\n\nThe bulk of feature information is here from\nthe [original 2.0 release features](http://dynamobim.org/to-dynamo-2-0-and-beyond).\n\nHere is\nadditional [feature information on extensions](http://dynamobim.org/extensions-now-supported-in-package-manager).\n\nKeep in mind that users can also have 2.x installed side-by-side with 1.x, so if they want to do their own comparison, this is pretty easy.\n\nAgain, if the user is going to upgrade, definitely take the latest build (2.0.2)\n\nMore information on [what it takes to upgrade packages](http://dynamobim.org/new-dynamo-developer-resources-and-updating-packages-for-dynamo-2-0).\n\nFinally, here are the more granular [release notes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\nI hope this provides a good and professional complete answer to your question."

This will establish an update process that allows users to get the latest version of Dynamo with the latest release and point release of Revit. Additionally, we intend for future releases of Dynamo to not have a shared library, allowing for different versions of Revit to have different version of Dynamo and remove the \"cross talk\" of Dynamo in new installations. This will allowg Revit v.A to have the most up to date version of Dynamo available when Revit v.A was released, and Revit v.B to have the most up to date version of Dynamo available when Revit v.B was released without version B installation interfering with version A."

What is the difference between the two?  (I know one derives from the other)\n\nA related question is: what's the difference between Element and FamilyInstance?  I can't understand why stairs are of class Stairs (derived from Element), while doors are of class FamilyInstance.  Are stairs not an \"instance\" of a particular \"family\"?\n\n**Answer:** Families come in several flavours.\n\nThe two main ones are standard and built-in.\n\nActually, they are called 'component' and 'system', as I just learned from the developer guide section I point out below:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/family_system_versus_component.png\" alt=\"System versus component families\" width=\"492\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">System versus component families</p>\n</center>\n\nStandard are defined in RFA family definitions.\n\nBuilt-in are built into Revit directly.\n\nStandard families define family symbols, and when you place a family symbol, it is represented by a family instance.\n\nOther elements placed in the model are not called family instances; they are just elements.\n\nElement is a super-class of FamilyInstance.\n\nAnalogously, ElementType is a superclass of FamilySymbol.\n\nI hope this explains.\n\nFor more info, check\nthe [Revit API developer guide](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_html) in\nthe [online Revit help](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU), in the\nsection [Introduction](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_html)\n&rarr; [Elements Essentials](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Elements_Essentials_html)\n&rarr; [Other Classifications](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2019/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Elements_Essentials_Other_Classifications_html)."
