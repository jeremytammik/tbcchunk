If the thing ends with</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> 'y', the plural is assumes to end with 'ies', </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> e.g. </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> (2, 'chair') -- '2 chairs'</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> (2, 'property') -- '2 properties'</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> (2, 'furniture item') -- '2 furniture items'</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> If in doubt, appending 'item' or 'entry' to </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> the thing description is normally a pretty </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> safe bet. Replaces calls to PluralSuffix </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> and PluralSuffixY.</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> </span><span class=\"gray\">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"blue\">public</span> <span class=\"blue\">static</span> <span class=\"blue\">string</span> PluralString(\n    <span class=\"blue\">int</span> n,\n    <span class=\"blue\">string</span> thing )\n  {\n    <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( 1 == n )\n    {\n      <span class=\"blue\">return</span> <span class=\"maroon\">\"1 \"</span> + thing;\n    }\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">int</span> i = thing.Length - 1;\n    <span class=\"blue\">char</span> cy = thing[i];\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">return</span> n.ToString() + <span class=\"maroon\">\" \"</span> + ( ( <span class=\"maroon\">'y'</span> == cy )\n      ? thing.Substring( 0, i ) + <span class=\"maroon\">\"ies\"</span>\n      : thing + <span class=\"maroon\">\"s\"</span> );\n  }\n</pre><p>I can use the new method to simplify some of my message generation and logging code, e.g. like this:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"teal\">Debug</span>.Print( <span class=\"maroon\">\"Selected {0} from {1} displaying \"</span>\n    + <span class=\"maroon\">\"{2}, {3} with HasMaterialQuantities=true\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralString( Count, <span class=\"maroon\">\"category\"</span> ),\n    <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralString( _nViews, <span class=\"maroon\">\"view\"</span> ),\n    <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralString( _nElements, <span class=\"maroon\">\"element\"</span> ),\n    _nElementsWithCategorMaterialQuantities );\n</pre><p>That previously looked like this:</p><pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"teal\">Debug</span>.Print( <span class=\"maroon\">\"Selected {0} categor{1} from \"</span>\n    + <span class=\"maroon\">\"{2} view{3} displaying {4} element{5}, \"</span>\n    + <span class=\"maroon\">\"{6} with HasMaterialQuantities=true\"</span>,\n    Count, <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralSuffixY( Count ),\n    _nViews, <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralSuffix( _nViews ),\n    _nElements, <span class=\"teal\">Util</span>.PluralSuffix( _nElements ),\n    _nElementsWithCategorMaterialQuantities );\n</pre><p>An example of the resulting message is identical:</p><pre>\n  Selected 5 categories from 5 views displaying\n  1901 elements, 877 with HasMaterialQuantities=true\n</pre><p>All is well in the best of all worlds if we can worry our pretty little heads about this kind of trivia, isn't it?</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
