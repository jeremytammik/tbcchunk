The supported functionality for each Revit version is as follows:\n\n- Revit 2018\n    - Open IFC\n    - Export IFC\n- Revit 2019\n    - Open IFC\n    - Export IFC\n    - Link IFC\n- Revit 2020 (coming soon)\n    - Open IFC\n    - Export IFC\n    - Link IFC\n\nAdditional documentation will be added asap.\n\nRevit 2018 does not support link IFC functionality at this time.\n\nThis support will come in handy for my [IfcSpaceZoneBoundaries project](https://github.com/jeremytammik/IfcSpaceZoneBoundaries).\n\nIt needs to link in an IFC file into a Revit project to generate certain room and space information.\n\nThat was previously not possible in the Forge DA4R environment, and now it is.\n\nMany thanks to Ryan and The Factory for this important step forward!\n\nPlease refer to The Building Coder topic group\nfor [more information on DA4R](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55)."

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> RevitLookup Snoop Enhancements\n\nAlexander [@CADBIMDeveloper](https://github.com/CADBIMDeveloper) Ignatovich, aka Александр Игнатович,\nshared several useful improvements for the RevitLookup snoop commands in\nhis [pull request #52](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/52); he explains:\n\nI added some improvements that I require in\nthe [RevitLookup tool](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) during\nmy development process. So here they are :-)\n\nAdded to the main results data window:\n\n- Dependent elements\n- View filter overrides and visibility\n- Element state in different phases\n\nFirst of all, I added the results of calling the `GetDependentElements` method to the main tool window.\nI faced the situation when I explored the dependent elements of the dependent element (e.g., the dependency tree).\nIt was also useful to explore the dependent elements of the results by collecting the database elements using the `lookup` method in the Revit Iron Python Shell.\n\nFurther, I worked a lot with view filter overrides and visibility. I wanted to see these in the lookup tool. So, I added the `View.GetFilterOverrides` and `View.GetFilterVisibility` method results to the objects window.\n\nFor the last improvement, I explored the element statuses in different phases, so I also added this functionality as well.\n\nHere is the complete list of changes:\n\n- allow RevitLookup to snoop dependent elements via main interface\n- preserve alphabetical methods order and simplify the code\n- the first step to allow create \"Objects\" form elements with predefined titles\n- introduce snoopable object wrapper to simplify the code\n- extract method\n- extract methods\n- extract data factory and simplify the code of ElementMethodsStream class\n- snoop view filter overrides settings\n- colour components are not available for invalid colour values\n- allow to snoop view filters visibility values\n- snoop Element.GetPhaseStatus\n- rename class\n\nSome of these enhancement are hosted in new C# snooping modules:\n\n- Snoop/CollectorExts\n    - DataFactory.cs\n- Snoop/Data\n    - ElementPhaseStatuses.cs\n    - SnoopableObjectWrapper.cs\n    - ViewFiltersOverrideGraphicSettings.cs\n    - ViewFiltersVisibilitySettings.cs\n\nHere is a sample model containing a wall with two dependent elements, a door and a window:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/snoop_dependent_model.png\" alt=\"Sample model with door in wall\" width=\"447\">\n</center>\n\nSnooping the wall data lists the two dependent elements:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/snoop_dependent_wall.png\" alt=\"List of wall dependent element ids\" width=\"636\">\n</center>\n\nClicking on the list enables us to jump straight into the dependent element data:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/snoop_dependent_door.png\" alt=\"Snooping the door data\" width=\"699\">\n</center>\n\nMany thanks to Alex for his clean implementation and kind sharing of these powerful enhancements!\n\nThe new enhancements are integrated\nin [RevitLookup release 2020.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2020.0.0.1)."
