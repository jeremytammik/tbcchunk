Autodesk Revit LT automatically manages iterative changes to building models throughout the documentation process. As a result, a consistent representation of the building is maintained, helping to improve drawing coordination and reducing errors.\n<li>Design and visualize in 3D. Revit LT allows users to see their designs virtually, improving their understanding of the building and its spaces, and helping them communicate design ideas to clients more clearly and effectively.\n<li>Create photorealistic renderings in the cloud. Users who purchase Autodesk Subscription with Revit LT can render in the cloud directly from the Revit LT interface, enabling them to produce compelling, photorealistic visualizations without tying up their desktop\n<li>Exchange designs in the DWG or RVT file formats. Produce designs in the DWG file format, and experience fluid file exchange with project team members using other Autodesk Revit software applications.\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<h5>Availability</h5>\n<p>Autodesk Revit LT 2013 is scheduled to be available within the month in North America and in select countries worldwide. \nThe product is available as a standalone version and as part of the new AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2013, which includes both Autodesk Revit LT 2013 and AutoCAD LT 2013.   \nProduct availability varies by country. \nDetails and purchasing options are available at \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/revitlt\">www.autodesk.com/revitlt</a>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
