[RPThomas108](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1035859) Thomas\nshared some valuable hints and examples of polygon area algorithms answering a question on how to obtain\nthe [area of a wall opening](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/area-of-a-wall-opening/m-p/12174104):\n\n**Question:** How can I calculate the area of a wall opening?\nI cannot delete any object.\n\n**Answer:** You can delete an object temporarily inside a transaction that is never committed, so the changes are never stored in the database:\n\n- [Calculating gross and net wall areas](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/calculating-gross-and-net-wall-areas.html)\n- [Gross and net wall area calculation enhancement](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/gross-and-net-wall-area-calculation-enhancement-and-events.html)\n\n**Response:** I cannot delete elements, even transitory.\n\n**Answer:** Here is a possible solution, except for ruled faces (for ruled faces, there must be a mathematical approximation similar to below):\n\nGenerally, for other types of faces you can find the inner loops of the face and use `Edge.GetCurveUV` to create a loop in the dimensions of the face parameters.\nUnfortunately, there is no tessellate for `CurveUV`, but you can evaluate points along the loop to get a set of ordered UVs.\nEach `U` and `V` can then be multiplied based on how the face is parameterised in that direction, i.e., for a planar face, it 1 in both directions, but for a cylindrical face the `U` is based on angles, so, instead you have to multiply it based on radius to get the segment length (`V` is still in length, so you can use 1 for that).\nPrior to the existence of `CurveUV`, you would likely have had to have used `Edge.EvaluateOnFace` to create the tessellated points.\n\nOnce you've multiplied the UV's, you can create a polygon and use\nthe [shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) etc. to find the area of the polygon and so the surface area of the opening.\n\nIt is hard for faces with normalised parametrisation (such as ruled faces), because the multiple used to convert normalised to raw in one direction changes along the other direction.\nFor example, if you have a ruled surface between two lines of different length, one at the base (Vmin) and one at the top (Vmax), the length varies from base to top, so how you convert `U` to raw parameter isn't constant, but varies according to the height of `V` where `U` is being measured.\n\nHow we measure openings in surfaces can also be a bit subjective to a degree.\nIf you have a cylindrical wall, then the area for the same opening on the outer face will be larger than the inner, but neither, I suspect, will likely be the thing that is useful to an MEP engineer.\nI assume they would likely want the projected (flat opening area).\nFor this, you would probably have to take the worst case (inner area) and project it onto a plane to establish what can fit into that 2D area (or how much ventilation you have).\n\nAnother method I used in the past for 2D is to tesselate the perimeter and fill the opening with a grid of points, then\nuse [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) etc., adding up the sum area of resulting triangles.\nThe area is always slightly underestimated for concave edges and slightly overestimated for convex edges.\nUsing smaller triangles obviously improves that but also increases processing time.\n\nAnother option is to create a single faced solid over the opening with one of the shape builders.\nSome surface types are not supported by all shape builders, however.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/area_of_wall_opening_1.png\" alt=\"Area of wall opening\" title=\"Area of wall opening\" width=\"800\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 450 Pixel Width: 1,087 -->\n</center>\n\nYou can then extract the surface area of those.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/area_of_wall_opening_2.png\" alt=\"Area of wall opening\" title=\"Area of wall opening\" width=\"800\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 439 Pixel Width: 1,082 -->\n</center>\n\nI think walls are quite simple compared to floors.\nIn shaped floors, especially, you don't always get inner loops.\nFor example, in the below there are no inner loops.\nThe thing you do know however is that the actual outline edges always have vertical faces adjacent.\nTherefore, fold edges always contain two horizontal or quasi-horizontal faces.\nSo, by elimination of those that way, you are left with the outline edge curves and it is then just a case of ordering them into loops and determining if they are outer or inner.\nYou can't rely on direction of curve for that because in reality they are all outer edges to their face.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/area_of_wall_opening_3.png\" alt=\"Area of wall opening\" title=\"Area of wall opening\" width=\"600\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 566 Pixel Width: 1,065 -->\n</center>\n\nSo, there isn't a universal solution to these things.\n\nMany thanks to Richard for sharing his thoughts and extensive experience on this!"
