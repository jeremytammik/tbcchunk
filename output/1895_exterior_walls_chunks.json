Then, it’s just a matter of getting room boundaries, filtering out the RSLs, appending the remaining elements to your list, deleting the room and RSLs, and moving up to the next level. It may not work for some bad modelling cases, but catches most.\n  After further discussion with the development team, they asked: Is the building model enclosed? It needs to be in order for the analyzer to work. In other words, do you have Roof and Floor elements to form enclosed spaces in the model?\n  Ten days later:\n  Several possible approaches to [retrieve all exterior walls](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/05/filterrule-use-and-retrieving-exterior-walls.html#2)\n  Now a discussion between ...\n\n- Get the walls, ceiling and floor of a room?\n  https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/get-the-walls-ceiling-and-floor-of-a-room/m-p/9915923\n\n- typography:\n  The Reason Comic Sans Is a Public Good\n  https://www.thecut.com/2020/08/the-reason-comic-sans-is-a-public-good.html\n  I am a bit of a typography junkie and pay far too much fanatic attention to that aspect of a text.\n  I sometimes fell forced to reformat a text just to make it more readable before I even start to take it in.\n  Until now, I have always gone for pretty standard fonts and avoided Comic Sans.\n  I am surprised to learn that there are good reasons not to continue doing so:\n\ntwitter:\n\nRetrieving outer boundaries of buildings and rooms, exterior walls and room bounding elements with the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon http://autode.sk/exteriorwalls\n\nLet's look at the outer boundaries of both buildings and rooms today\n&ndash; Finding exterior walls continued\n&ndash; Retrieving room bounding elements\n&ndash; Comic Sans is a public good...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nRetrieving outer boundaries of buildings and rooms, exterior walls and room bounding elements with the #RevitAPI\n\nhttp://autode.sk/exteriorwalls\n\nLet's look at the outer boundaries of both buildings and rooms today:\n\n- Finding exterior walls continued\n- Retrieving room bounding elements\n- Comic Sans is a public good...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">\n<a href=\"\"></a>\n</p>\n</center>\n\n-->"

The main part &ndash; \nFrom the centre of the LocationCurve of the wall, two perpendicular rays (long lines) are shot on either side of the LocationCurve.\nDetermine the number of intersections of these rays with other walls.\nIf the number of intersections on one side is zero, this is an outer wall.\n2. An additional part &ndash; \nThe first part will not find all the walls, so the second pass should check the remaining walls at the intersections with the found exterior walls: if the wall with its ends connects to the two outer walls, it means it is also external\n\nThe working capacity of this algorithm is almost ideal.\n\nHere are the results of my algorithm:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ap_exterior_walls_1.png\" alt=\"Exterior walls\" title=\"Exterior walls\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 493 -->\n<br/>\n<img src=\"img/ap_exterior_walls_2.png\" alt=\"Exterior walls\" title=\"Exterior walls\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 591 -->\n</center>\n\nI describe the algorithm in more detail in my article\non [Revit: Exterior Wall Search Algorithm](https://blog.modplus.org/index.php/11-revitapi/10-revit-find-external-walls-algorithm).\n\nThe code is provided in\nthe [RevitFindExteriorWalls GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pekshev/RevitFindExteriorWalls).\n\nLucas: how do you solve the problem of having an interior wall that touches 2 exterior walls?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ap_exterior_walls_3.png\" alt=\"Exterior walls\" title=\"Exterior walls\" width=\"600\"/> <!-- 857 -->\n</center>\n\nАлександр: Today, I figured out the problem in your example.\nIn this case, it is necessary to improve the second part of the check and introduce some additional checks.\nThere will always be special cases.\nThe screenshot shows that three walls are connected there in one place &ndash; it seems to me that this needs to be taken into account.\n\nIn the 'main part' of the algorithm, if there are intersections on both sides of the wall, then it is internal.\nAnd the connections at the ends of the wall are no longer important.\n\nLucas: Thanks for your response.\nWhat I did is use 3 rays at different angles from each side: 45, 90 and 135 degrees.\nIf at least one of the rays doesn't hit anything, it's an exterior wall.\nThis took care of the special cases I had so far.\nI believe shallower angles might be best.\nSo, maybe something like (5, 90, 175) will probably yield better, more correct results.\nAnother thing is I am not levelling the location lines.\nMeaning that walls have to be on the same level to intersect each other.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ap_exterior_walls_4.png\" alt=\"Exterior walls\" title=\"Exterior walls\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 454 -->\n</center>\n\nAll blue walls are exterior, and the garage in the top right is on a different level of the rest.\n\nAnother approach that worked is using a convex hull to find at least one exterior wall (any location line that intersects the hull is an outermost wall).\nThen, from the selected exterior wall, move counterclockwise, always trying to find a right turn; this is a bit slower, but needs no special cases to work with all the projects I've tested.\n\nАлександр: Convex hull is suitable if the outer walls form a precise chain of connections.\nBut it is not always the case.\nIn addition, there it will be necessary to collect these very connections, which is also not an easy task (there are many nuances).\n\nWhile writing the message, another idea came to mind:\n\n1. Determine the overall contour of all selected walls and find the midpoint\n2. Around the contour with an indent from the contour, throw the rays towards the midpoint. Throw the rays through a certain step.\n\nThe first wall that intersects with the ray is the outer one.\n\nInteresting idea! Need to try it out.\n\nSo, it is necessary to clarify that this is not a 100% solution and some special cases turn out to be expensive.\n\nMany thanks to Alexander and Lucas for the interesting discussion."

(trying to detect related walls, floors and ceilings of a room).\n\n**Answer:** I would try different approach for that.\nYou could try to use the [`IsPointInRoom` method](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/96e29ddf-d6dc-0c40-b036-035c5001b996.htm) instead? \n\nFor ceiling, wall and floor, you can just take the centre points and project the points to the room.\n\n**Response:** You say, 'project the points to room.'\nI'm not sure I understand this part.\nI guess you can draw a line from the centroid of the room to the centroid of the walls?\n\nThe inherent problem I see is that the centroid of each wall/floor/ceiling is going to be outside each room since it is its shell. It's almost like we need to offset each room's volume to encompass the centroids of its shells.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/room_bounding_elements_3_wall_middle.jpg\" alt=\"Wall middle\" title=\"Wall middle\" width=\"400\"/> <!-- 1794 -->\n</center>\n\nTypo:\n\n- blue line = extent of *room*\n\n**Answer:** Example: choose centre face of wall, then project the point according to normal by .\nThen, use the `IsPointInRoom` method for each point; you should have 2 rooms for a single wall.\nIt is easier with ceilings and floor finishes.\n\n**Response:** Interesting.\n\nI can imagine lots of problems with this approach; for instance, a corridor that borders 20 rooms will only detect one room on each side.\n\nSame with a floor or ceiling being shared by multiple rooms.\nEspecially if the designers were lazy and modelled the floors/ceilings to go through walls.\n\nIt's a very interesting problem, I will keep pondering it.\nI'm actually surprised there's no direct way to do this directly in the API or in Revit schedules.\nFeels like every walls should know what rooms accost them and all rooms should know what surfaces bound them.\n\n**Answer:** I think you can start another thread on that particular topic.\n\nIn the meantime, I think the first question has been resolved.\n\nMany thanks to Samuel and Yien for the interesting discussion, and to Yien for all his good suggestions!"
