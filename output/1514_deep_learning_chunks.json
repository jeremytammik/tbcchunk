It introduces\nnew [`NurbSpline` methods](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/cfb90f78-dc27-a305-031d-5e4ffac8a9ce.htm) for\nconverting a Hermite spline to `NurbSpline` or `Curve`:\n\n- [Create (HermiteSpline)](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/63ae2cbb-72eb-0e56-2d04-c7edb82a43cd.htm) &ndash; create a new geometric `NurbSpline` object from a `HermiteSpline`.\n- [CreateCurve (HermiteSpline)](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/c0191746-fdd6-4f24-cfb7-29a6a88bc05b.htm) &ndash; create a new geometric `Curve` object by converting the given `HermiteSpline`. The created curve may be a `NURBSpline` or a simpler curve such as line or arc.\n\n\n####<a name=\"7\"></a>Lots of Literature on Deep Learning\n\nAs I mentioned last month, I would like to experiment with an [automated system to answer the most common recurring questions on the Revit API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/10/ai-edit-and-continue.html#3).\n\nThe most inspiring motivation out there for me so far is \nthe [deep learning based teaching assistant Jill Watson](http://www.news.gatech.edu/2016/05/09/artificial-intelligence-course-creates-ai-teaching-assistant) implemented\nby Professor Ashok Goel, who teaches Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence (KBAI) at the Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing.\n\nHere is a quote from a pre-Jill paper by Ashok Goel et al\non [Using Watson for Enhancing Human-Computer Co-Creativity](http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/FSS/FSS15/paper/viewFile/11713/11472) in\nwhich Jill is mentioned as work in progress:\n\n<!---- by Ashok Goel, Brian Creeden, Mithun Kumble, Shanu Salunke, Abhinaya Shetty, Bryan Wiltgen at the Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology; goel@cc.gatech.edu, brian.creeden@gatech.edu, mkumble3@gatech.edu, salunkeshanu91@gmail.com, shetty_abhinaya@yahoo.co.in, bryan.wiltgen@gatech.edu ---->\n\n<i>We are presently exploring the use of Watson as a cognitive system for answering frequently asked questions in an online class. Goel ... teaches an online course ... as part of Georgia Techâ€™s Online MS in CS program. The online course uses [Piazza](https://piazza.com) as the forum for online class discussions. The classroom discussions on the Piazza forum in the KBAI course tend to be both extensive and intensive, attracting about ~6950 and ~11,000 messages from ~170 and ~240 students in the Fall 2014 and the Spring 2015 classes, respectively. We believe that the large numbers of messages in the discussion forums are indicative of the strong motivation and deep engagement of the students in the KBAI classes. Nevertheless, these large numbers also make for significant additional work for the teaching team that needs to monitor all messages and answer a good subset of them. Thus, using the questions and answers from the Fall 2014 and Spring 2015 KBAI classes, we are developing a new Watson-powered technology to automatically answer frequently asked questions in future offerings of the online KBAI class.</i>\n\nThe result was successful and inspiring, cf. Ashok's [20-minute presentation about a teaching assistant named Jill Watson](https://youtu.be/WbCguICyfTA) at TEDx in San Francisco:\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WbCguICyfTA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n[Jill Watson, round three](http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/01/09/jill-watson-round-three),\nis coming up now as the Georgia Tech course prepares for its third semester with virtual teaching assistants.\n\nI spent some time yesterday browsing the Internet on this topic and discovered an overwhelming amount of interesting information, most of which I just skimmed over.\n\nHere is the table of contents, mainly for my personal use and future reference:\n\n- [Natural language understanding](http://www.jfsowa.com/talks/nlu.pdf) including interesting facts on Google Translate\n- [What Watson is about](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ontolog-forum/SjYwxXr7xBQ)\n- [Is Big Data Taking Us Closer to the Deeper Questions in Artificial Intelligence?](https://www.edge.org/conversation/gary_marcus-is-big-data-taking-us-closer-to-the-deeper-questions-in-artificial) &ndash; long conversation with  Gary Marcus in April 2016.\n- [Deep Learning Winter School References](http://dl4mt.computing.dcu.ie/DL4MT-ref.html)\n- [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/) &ndash; commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written for Java and Scala.\n- [List of open-source deep learning frameworks](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/14/deep-learning-frameworks/)\n- [Facebook Open-Sources Deep Learning Project Torchnet](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/07/facebook-opensource-torchnet)\n- [FAIR open sources deep-learning modules for Torch](https://research.fb.com/fair-open-sources-deep-learning-modules-for-torch/)\n- [RNN &ndash; recurrent neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)\n- [Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation](https://github.com/swordyork/dcnmt) based on Theano and Blocks in Python.\n- [Watson natural language question answering computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29)\n- [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/)\n- [Watson Developer Cloud Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-developer-cloud)\n- [Question answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering)\n- [OpenEphyra](https://github.com/TScottJ/OpenEphyra), an open framework for question answering (QA).\n- [Sempre](https://github.com/percyliang/sempre) &ndash; Semantic Parser with Execution.\n- [Qanus Question-Answering by NUS](http://www.qanus.com/), National University of Singapore.\n- [Adam QAS](https://github.com/5hirish/adam_qas)\n- [Yodaqa](https://github.com/brmson/yodaqa) &ndash; A Question Answering system built on top of the Apache UIMA framework &rarr; [web site](http://ailao.eu/yodaqa).\n- [Uncc2014watsonsim](https://github.com/SeanTater/uncc2014watsonsim) &ndash; Open-domain question answering system from UNC Charlotte.\n- [Watsonsim](http://blog.watsonphd.com)\n- [Domain Specific Question Answering System](http://www.irdindia.in/journal_ijeecs/pdf/vol3_iss2/8.pdf): Closed-Domain QA System: Closed-domain question answering deals with the questions under a specific domain, and can be seen as an easier task because NLP systems can exploit domain-specific knowledge frequently formalized in ontologies. It has very high accuracy but requires extensive language processing and limited to one domain. The example of such a system is medicines or automotive maintenance.\n- [A Question Answering System on Domain Specific Knowledge with Semantic Web Support](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261795194_A_question_answering_system_on_domain_specific_knowledge_with_semantic_web_support) &ndash; for Slovenian.\n- [Creating a Natural Language Question Answering System with IBM Watson](https://fartashh.github.io/post/qa-system-watson/) provides some practical implementation guidance and real-world advice.\n- [Creating Domain-specific Question Answering Systems](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/12225/creating-domain-specific-question-answering-systems) &ndash; In short, the typical approach people took: (i) build a knowledge base from domain specific articles and/or Wikipedia (ii) index these articles with lucene or other IR system (iii) for each question/answer pair, retrieve most relevant articles and use them as features (iv) build a classifier using these features to classifying whether an answer is correct or incorrect.\n- [Approaches for implementing Domain-specific Question answering Systems](http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/12248/approaches-for-implementing-domain-specific-question-answering-system) &ndash; IR == Information retrieval, Ontology based, Machine learning; all the best systems (e.g., IBM Watson) use a hybrid approach.\n\nThe last three are most practical, down to earth and provide quick and easily accessible introductions including practical implementation aspects.\n\nMy next moves might be registering for an IBM Watson account and starting to assemble test cases and a base data set for training."
