But copying those files into the above .bundle folder results in the plugin not appearing on the toolbar. No error is raised. No amount of adding or editing xml files, putting the DLLs in Contents, etc. seems to help. I watched all the Autodesk videos on this and read all the docs. Can you advise how I can best resolve this issue pls?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Do you plan to submit your plugin as an exchange store app this week?</p><p>If so, let's make sure we get it fixed during the Portathon at the latest.</p><p>Have you downloaded and installed any other apps? You could use them to compare with own your setup.</p><p>Does your add-in no longer load at all, or is it just a problem that it does not load dynamically during runtime, without restarting Revit?</p><p>I heard of an issue regarding the new AllowLoadIntoExistingSession tag in the add-in manifest file, so it would be good to ensure that your problem is different.</p><p>Another thing to check is your XML file encoding:\nIn my experience, you can use\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/snow-and-woe-with-manifest-files.html\">\nany encoding you want in the Revit add-in manifest</a>, but it must correspond to the coding specified in the corresponding XML file tag, i.e.,\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/addin-manifest-and-guidize.html#3\">\nthe tag must tell the truth</a>.</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/revit-2014-obj-exporter-and-new-sdk-samples.html?cid=6a00e553e168978833019aff5983a6970b#comment-6a00e553e168978833019aff5983a6970b\"></a>Response:</strong> Thanks for all the suggestions Jeremy.</p><p>The plugin does not load even after a Revit restart.</p><p>It may be my Revit knowledge, but I found getting the plugin to run under the other Autodesk CAD packages to be relatively straightforward – and they also provide a reasonable level of diagnosis, whereas with Revit I was unable to determine if the plugin had in fact loaded or not. This is compounded by not being able to run Revit directly from the Visual Studio debugger (it crashes), so there is a need to run Revit from the desktop then attach in Visual Studio, by which time you may have missed some debug opportunities when the plugin loads.</p><p>AllowLoadIntoExistingSession is not present in the add-in file.</p><p>My suspicion is that the plugin does not load from the <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\ApplicationPlugins</code> folder because Revit is not loading the required DLLs when it's in that folder, whereas they are loaded from <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2014</code>. But diagnosing this is very difficult. The other possibility is as you say, that it could be an XML issue.</p><p>To add to my confusion, I downloaded your latest OBJ exporter, compiled it, copied (dll &amp; addin) into <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2014</code> and the ObjExport.dll did not load. I had to put ObjExport.dll into the Revit 2014 executable folder to get it to load.</p><p>There needs to be a log file to indicate what is and is not being loaded, and if it's not being loaded, why.</p><p>Thanks again for your suggestions and comments.\nVery much appreciated.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sorry to hear about your struggles, and thank you for your appreciation.</p><p>I have no issues launching Revit from the Visual Studio 2010 debugger.\nWhen I do that, I can see my add-in being loaded by Revit in the debug output window.</p><p>Just copying the .NET assembly DLL and the add-in manifest to the ApplicationPlugins is not sufficient.\nThe add-in manifest is only read when you place it in the Addins folder.\nThe ApplicationPlugins location requires a PackageContents.xml file instead.\nSo you must have missed one or two small details in the docs after all  :-)</p><p>Anyway, as you presumably know, we are running the Autodesk Exchange Store\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/multireferenceannotation-example.html\">\nPortathon event today</a>.</p><p>I therefore passed on your query to both the Revit API development team and my colleagues dealing with the exchange store, and they reply as follows:</p><ol>\n<li>Do you have a PackageContents.xml file in the bundle folder?\nRevit is configured to look for Revit apps inside the PackageContents.xml files in this location.\nIt is not configured to directly load .addin files from there.\nIf the plugin is working from <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Autodesk\\Revit\\Addins\\2014</code>, which seems to be the case, and you are ready to submit it to the appstore, we would generate a PackageContents.xml file for you and you can test it from there.</li>\n<li>We created an installer using the files submitted by the publisher. It seems to be working fine. The add-in is getting loaded for Revit 2014. The bundle will be placed in <code>%ProgramData%\\Autodesk\\ApplicationPlugin</code>.\nWe will be testing the app next week and contact the publisher regarding this directly.</li>\n</ol><p>I hope this matches you intentions!</p><p><strong><a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/revit-2014-obj-exporter-and-new-sdk-samples.html?cid=6a00e553e168978833019aff5c8e9a970c#comment-6a00e553e168978833019aff5c8e9a970c\"></a>Response:</strong>\nThank you Jeremy.\nYes that very much matches our intentions.</p><p>Back to the main topic:</p><a name=\"4\"></a>"
