Only a little part of the blogpost somewhere in the future.\n  Recently I faced with a performance issue getting pipes insulation. My previous implementation looked like this:\n  var pipeInsulation = pipe\n    .GetDependentElements(new ElementClassFilter(typeof(PipeInsulation)))\n    .Select(pipe.Document.GetElement)\n    .Cast<PipeInsulation>()\n    .FirstOrDefault();\n  I didn't notice it before because I tested the code on a small model, however in the big model entire calculation tooked more than hour. Calculations were also huge, so I spent some time trying to figure out what is going wrong. Now the solution looks like this:\n  var pipeInsulation = InsulationLiningBase\n    .GetInsulationIds(pipe.Document, pipe.Id)\n    .Select(pipe.Document.GetElement)\n    .OfType<PipeInsulation>()\n    .FirstOrDefault();\n  Now the entire calculations take seconds instead of hours.\n  This issue is related only to MEP; I haven't faced any other performance issues usng the `GetDependentElements` method.\n  thank you very much for the interesting observation!\n\n- programming languages to learn\n  email [Computational Strategy - Question for the Expert] Andrea Rolle\n  [Q] We are now starting our in-house computational strategy in order to automate processes on both Revit-Dynamo and Inventor-iLogic and I am struggling to decide which language code we should start to learn.\n  C#, Python or F#? I am moving my first steps into coding but I have a few years of experience on Dynamo & Grasshopper. \n  I would like to add that our Inventor has got an automation interface developed by a consultant company written in F# which eventually we would like to take control over it in the long term.\n  Long story short I would like to understand the pro and cons about  which language should we start to learn (between C#, Python and F#) to better unify a future workflow between Revit and Inventor, keeping in mind that we have something in house already developed in F#.\n  [A] I would say:\n  - Python: best fpr learning, and for Dynamo\n  - C# best for pure Revit API, most example code, cleanest .NET interface\n  - F# best for stateless procedural generic logical lambda computation, and you'll need it in the long run anyway\n\n/Users/jta/a/doc/revit/tbc/git/a % tbcsh_search.py language\n0163:Language Integrated Query Linq\n0178:Language Independent Category Access\n0188:A .NET Language Learning Resource\n0512:Language Independent Subcategory Creation\n0799:Running Language Code and More Exporters\n0930:MUI: Multiple Language Interface Update\n0946:Removing Extreneous Mac Architectures, Languages and Files\n0948:All-zero Language Codes in the Revit Product GUID\n0998:Language Independent Section View Type Id Retrieval\n1078:Multi-language Shared Parameters\n1347:The Most Popular Programming Languages 2015\n1368:<\"#15\">Choose a Programming Language\n1368:<\"#16\">Converting Code from One Language to Another\n1523:Multiple Language RESX Resource Files\n1523:<\"#2\">Supporting Multiple Language Resource Files\n1792:<\"#5\"> Most Popular Programming Languages 1965-2019\n1838:2021 Migration, Add-In Language, BIM360 Research\n1838:<\"#3\"> What Language to choose for a Revit Add-In?\n1880:<\"#3\"> Más Allá de Dynamo &ndash;
