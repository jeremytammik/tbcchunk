All the basic functionality and most objects that I have ever had occasion to use are provided in all three flavours.\n\n<p>If you try to access a property that is not available in the particular flavour of Revit that your application is running in, the property will generally simply return a null value or sometimes throw an exception, as Shifali is currently painfully discovering, being\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/new-2010-events.html#comments\">\nunable to access the gbXML settings in Revit Architecture</a>.\n\n<p>You can check what flavour you are running in by querying the application object as demonstrated by the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/files/rac_labs_2009-07-30.zip\">\nRevit API introduction labs</a> sample command Lab1_2_CommandArguments:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"teal\">Application</span> app = commandData.Application;\n  <span class=\"teal\">Document</span> doc = app.ActiveDocument;\n  <span class=\"teal\">View</span> view = commandData.View;\n  <span class=\"blue\">string</span> s = <span class=\"maroon\">\"Application = \"</span> + app.VersionName;\n  s += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\r\\nVersion = \"</span> + app.VersionNumber;\n  s += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\r\\nDocument path = \"</span> + doc.PathName;\n  s += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\r\\nDocument title = \"</span> + doc.Title;\n  s += <span class=\"maroon\">\"\\r\\nView name = \"</span> + view.Name;\n  <span class=\"teal\">LabUtils</span>.InfoMsg( s );\n</pre>\n<p>In the Revit 2010 API, new LanguageType and ProductType enumerations and corresponding properties on the application object were introduced to enable an add-in to query and analyse the underlying product and user interface language without resorting to any string comparisons:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"teal\">LanguageType</span> lt = app.Language;\n  <span class=\"teal\">ProductType</span> pt = app.Product;\n</pre>\n<p>We have previously taken a deeper look at the Revit \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/04/revit-structure-resources.html\">\nStructure</a> and \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/the-revit-mep-api.html\">\nMEP</a> APIs and mentioned some of the specific features of each.\n\n<p>The easiest way that I can think of to see the exact differences between the three flavours of the Revit API is to look at the class diagram in the Revit SDK provided in \"Revit API Class Diagram.png\".\nIt shows all of the namespaces and classes defined in the Revit API and colour codes them into various groups, including separate groups for the three product flavours.\n\n<p>The developer guide in the document \"Revit 2010 API Developer Guide.pdf\" also includes the three separate chapters dealing with the API specifics of each flavour:\n\n<ol start=\"23\">\n<li><b>Revit Architecture</b>\n<br/>23.1   Rooms\n<br/>23.2    Energy Data\n<li><b>Revit Structure</b>\n<br/>24.1   Structural Model Elements\n<br/>24.2   AnalyticalModel\n<br/>24.3   Loads\n<br/>24.4   Analysis Link\n<li><b>Revit MEP</b>\n<br/>25.1   MEP Element Creation\n<br/>25.2   Connectors\n<br/>25.3   Family Creation\n</li></li></li></ol>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
