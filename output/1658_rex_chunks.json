still, there is many more who are simply not aware of this.\n\nSome are now struggling to simply understand how to store a results package (e.g., internal structural analysis forces) into Revit elements, such as columns and beams, and how to retrieve it for, e.g., connections design.\n\nEverything you need for this is provided as part of the Revit SDK, by the Structural Analysis Software Development Toolkit (SDK), in the *Structural Analysis SDK* subfolder.\n\nThe first suggestion for seeing live how the structural analysis storage and reading works recommended starting from 2m50s in\nthe [Structural Analysis for Revit](https://youtu.be/kUFkrogww-o) video presentation in the AEC Collection Workflow series:\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kUFkrogww-o\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay;

\n</pre>\n\nThe user can select the folder to save the FBX file in.\n\nAfter it exports, I want to determine the selected directory where it was saved.\n \n**Answer:** The `Application` class provides a `FileExported` event, providing a `Path` property in its `FileExportedEventArgs` argument.\n\nThe `ControlledApplication` also provides this `FileExported` event.\n\n**Response:** Thank you!\n\nI tried using what you suggested and display a dialog box to pop up after exporting the fbx file that prints the file location:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  private void App_FileExported(object sender, FileExportedEventArgs e)\n  {\n    TaskDialog.Show(\"Test\", e.Path);\n  }\n</pre>\n\nIn the `IExternalApplication` `OnStartup` method, I added\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  app.FileExported += App_FileExported;\n</pre>\n\nThe task dialog pops up after exporting the FBX.\n\nHowever, it only works when I choose \"FBX files (*.fbx)\" under \"Files of type:\" in the FBX export dialogue box.\n\nIt doesn't when the default option \"FBX 2015 and Previous (*.fbx)\" is selected. \n\nWeird.\n\nWe are checking with the development team...\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>Driving NavisWorks Programmatically via ExecuteCommand\n\nAside from Revit, are you also using NavisWorks and would you like to drive it programmatically as well?\n\nIf so, check out JHoward_Hob's interesting [House of BIM](https://houseofbim.com/author/homeofbim) article on\nthe [NavisWorks .NET `ExecuteCommand` method](https://houseofbim.com/2017/05/21/naviworks-net-executecommand-method).\n\n\n####<a name=\"5\"></a>The Autodesk Assistant Ava and the Uncanny Valley\n\nAnother little news item that just happened to catch my attention,\non   [how Autodesk’s assistant Ava attempts to avoid uncanny valley](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/18/how-autodesks-assistant-ava-attempts-to-avoid-uncanny-valley).\n\nThat led me to look up [uncanny valley on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley):\n\n> In aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object.
