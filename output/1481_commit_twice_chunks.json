    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Isolating an Element in a Newly Created View Requires Two Transactions\n\nThe aim\nof [isolating an element in a newly created view](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/isolate-elements-on-a-newly-created-view/m-p/6206355) was\ndiscussed by Tuuletin, Revitalizer, Scott Wilson, FirstJet and Michal-sk in\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) and\nresolved by an interesting workaround discovered by Michael Morris, Principal Engineer of the Revit development team.\n\nThis is another example in the series of situations with a\nspecial [need to regenerate](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.33)\nand [handling transactions and transaction groups](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.53):\n\n**Question:** My isolation of an element in a newly created view does not work.\n \nI do the following:\n\n1. I have a set of elements to isolate `els = System.Collections.Generic.List(ElementId)`.\n2. Then a view is created: `view = ViewSection.CreateSection(doc, viewFamilyTypeId, BoundingBox)`.\n3. After that I try to isolate `els`: `view.IsolateElementsTemporary(els)`.\n\nIf I open this view, the isolation mode is on (light blue frame is on), but nothing from `els` is isolated. The other view parameters (via `get_Parameter`) are accessible and writeable.\n\nOn the other hand, `view.IsolateCategoriesTemporary()` works fine!\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\n**Answer:** Perhaps you need a call to `document.Regenerate` or `uiDocument.RefreshActiveView`?\n\n**Response:** No, this doesn't help.\n\nMore peculiarity: the 'reverse' method, `View.HideElements`, works perfectly!\n \nNow, I see no other way to solve my task.\n\nThe first collector will include any element in model (including links).\n\nThe second collector will include elements to be isolated.\n\nThe third collector consists of the first collector with the excluded second collector.\n\nThen, I just hide any element I don't want to be isolated by means of the third collector.\n \nSeems like a very bad way to evade this bug...\n\n**Answer:** Are the elements actually visible in the view if you don't enable the isolate?\n\n**Response:** Yes, they are visible.\n\nI create a new view (so, any graphic settings are set to default — all elements are visible), then I want to isolate some elements in this created view...\n\nI have stopped seeking the solution. Maybe it is just a lack of the Revit 2015 API. Hope, this will be fixed in later versions.\n\n**Question 2:** I would like to re-open this issue. It is still happening in Revit 2017. I have created a simple test case with macros embedded to show it\nin [isolate_element_in_new_view.rvt](zip/isolate_element_in_new_view.rvt):\n \n- `testOne` macro shows that we can isolate a element in the view.\n- `testTwo` macro duplicates the Level 1 floorplan view and tries to isolate a Element. But the element is not isolated, unexpected behaviour.\n\n**Answer:** I escalated this thread to an ADN case *12169975 [Isolate elements on a newly created view]* and created an internal development issue *REVIT-99069 [Isolate elements on a newly created view -- 12169975]* for the development team to take a closer look. They say:\n \nI can reproduce this issue. When just 1 transaction is used to create the new view and also to isolate the element, then the isolate element fails. \n \nHowever, I can get the desired behaviour using two separate transactions as follows:\n \n- Use a transaction to create the new view. Close transaction.\n- Activate the new view. This is important; isolation fails if the view is not active.\n- Use 2nd transaction to isolate the wall. Close transaction.\n \nIs this an acceptable workaround?\n \nNote: I also tried the attached file and macros in our internal development release cannot reproduce the behaviour there.\n \nI tested macro `test 2` which uses just 1 transaction to create the new view and isolate the wall, and when the screen updates the single wall is really and truly isolated in the new view.\n \nSo the workaround described above will not be needed forever.\n \nAlso, it appears the real issue here is that isolate element only works in the active view. For example, edit macro `testOne` to NOT activate floor plan Level 1. In the UI, open views Level 1 and Level 2 side by side, but make Level 2 be the active view. Run macro `testOne`. Notice that Level 1 view is not updated and the wall is not isolated.\n\nSo you need to activate the view before doing `IsolateElementTemporary`.\n\nIn fact, this appears to be needed for all uses of `IsolateElementTemporary`, regardless of if the view is newly created or not.\n \n\n**Response:** Thanks for the work around.\n\nI tried two transactions myself as well before, but it didn't work then.\n\nThe trick is, as you guys described, to set the active view to the new created view.\n \nHere is the working snippet for those interested:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span style=\"color:blue;\">public</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">void</span>&nbsp;testTwo(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">UIDocument</span>&nbsp;uidoc&nbsp;)\n{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Document</span>&nbsp;doc&nbsp;=&nbsp;uidoc.Document;\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">View</span>&nbsp;newView;\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">using</span>(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Transaction</span>&nbsp;t&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Transaction</span>(&nbsp;doc&nbsp;)&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.Start(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;Trans&quot;</span>&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;Get&nbsp;Floorplan&nbsp;for&nbsp;Level1&nbsp;and&nbsp;copy&nbsp;its&nbsp;</span>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;properties&nbsp;for&nbsp;ouw&nbsp;newly&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;ViewPlan.</span>\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">View</span>&nbsp;existingView&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.GetElement(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ElementId</span>(&nbsp;312&nbsp;)&nbsp;)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">View</span>;\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;Create&nbsp;new&nbsp;Floorplan.</span>\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newView&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.GetElement(&nbsp;existingView.Duplicate(&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ViewDuplicateOption</span>.Duplicate&nbsp;)&nbsp;)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">View</span>;\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.Commit();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;Important&nbsp;to&nbsp;set&nbsp;new&nbsp;view&nbsp;as&nbsp;active&nbsp;view.</span>\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uidoc.ActiveView&nbsp;=&nbsp;newView;\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.Start(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;Trans&nbsp;2&quot;</span>&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;Try&nbsp;to&nbsp;isolate&nbsp;a&nbsp;Wall.&nbsp;Fails.</span>\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newView.IsolateElementTemporary(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">new</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ElementId</span>(&nbsp;317443&nbsp;)&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t.Commit();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:green;\">//&nbsp;Change&nbsp;the&nbsp;View&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;View.</span>\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;uidoc.ActiveView&nbsp;=&nbsp;newView;\n}\n</pre>\n\nIt somewhat sucks having to commit twice and therefore having to regenerate twice. But the workaround is solid and does the job. Thanks guys!\n\nMany thanks indeed to everybody involved in this exploration, especially to Michael for his in-depth research and effective workaround!"

Here are my questions:\n\n1. Since the Forge platform is a set of cloud services: if I am developing an application for the desktop, e.g., Revit or NavisWorks, will this mean that the Forge Platform will not be relevant?\n2. Could you give some examples of companies/and apps that utilize the Data Management API? By using this API, can I access data from Revit via A360?\n3. Can the Model Derivative API translate the design into IFC format? Does it support IFC 4? Does it support the buildingSMART International standards for Model View Definitions, like reference view, design transfer view etc.?\n4. Can the Viewer render only SVF file format?\n5. Can you apply for the Forge Funding only if you are building apps using the Forge platform web services?\n\n**Answer:** Thank you very much for your pertinent questions.\n \nI discussed them with my colleagues, and we put together the following answers for you:\n \n1. Forge may be extremely important for a Revit or NavisWorks add-in or other desktop application.\nFor instance, if your Revit add-in needs to use A360, or connect with any of your own or the Autodesk or other web services, Forge may be very important indeed.\nThe number of web services is growing daily, and you should urgently consider implementing your own functionality along those lines as well.\nThat is the whole point of my presentation\non [freeing your BIM data](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/06/free-your-bim-data-and-roomedit3d-thee-legged-forge-oauth.html) that\nI held at the Forge Developer Conference in June.\nYou may want to make use of cloud services to address a larger audience with your application, and yet connect it back to the Revit BIM, cf. my newest sample on [connecting the desktop and the cloud](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/10/roomedit3dv3-up-and-running-with-demo-recording.html).\n2. If a CAD model is uploaded to A360 in a way that the references can be resolved, so it becomes viewable in the A360 UI, then it can be translated into SVF as well (in A360 this happens automatically), which will also trigger property generation for it that can be accessed through the Model Derivative endpoints as well as from the Viewer. \nAnyone uploading a file to translate for the viewer is using the Data Management API.\nUploading a file is a necessary part of the translation service.\nLook at the Forge samples on GitHub and the Forge DevCon presentations:\n    - [github.com/Developer-Autodesk](https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk)\n    - [github.com/Autodesk-Forge](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge)\n    - [forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2016](https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2016)\n3. Not yet.\nThe other way around is supported, IFC to Forge.\nWe are in the process of adding IFC support to the MD API right now.\nRevit itself offers IFC4 support.  What that means right now is:\n    - We generate IFC4 Reference View files.  These aren’t certified, because certification doesn’t exist yet.  We continue to improve our output so that our output passes certification, when it officially begins.\n    - We generate IFC4 Design Transfer View files.  These aren’t certified, because certification doesn’t exist yet.  Furthermore, there is still some discussion about what would be certified, which may lead to further modifications of this MVD.  We will continue to improve our output so that our output passes certification, when it officially begins and is finalized.\n    - For extraction, it is intended to work as well as Revit itself.\n4. `SVF` for 3D and `F2D` for 2D views.\nThe render format depends on the input format and its extension (`obj`, `glTF`, etc.).\nDifferent formats may interact slightly differently in the viewer regarding selection, metadata, etc.\nThe viewer is primarily intended to read the single file format (what we generically refer to as SVF for both 2D and 3D models).\nThe Model Derivative API allows you to convert all other formats into SVF.\nThe viewer is not intended to be a standalone multi-format viewer &ndash; it is intended to be used in conjunction with the Model Derivative API.\n5. You can apply without necessarily using Forge API.\nYou should definitely mention what Forge APIs and how you are planning to use them.\n \nI hope this helps."
