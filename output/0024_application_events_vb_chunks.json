There is no VB sample for this in the Revit SDK samples, so I created the following little solution to demonstrate it.</p><p>The steps to create it are exactly the same as for a C# project, and were actually described in detail for both C# and VB in the post on\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/debugging-a-rev.html\">\nDebugging a Revit Add-In</a>, but here is the really short version:</p><ul>\n<li>Create a new class library project</li>\n<li>Reference RevitAPI.dll</li>\n<li>Set its 'Copy Local' flag to false</li>\n<li>Derive your class from IExternalApplication</li>\n<li>Implement the member methods</li>\n</ul><p>I have copied the full Visual Studio solution AppEventsVb <a href=\"\">here</a>. It is very straight forward to create from scratch, actually, and using Intellisense as much as possible really helps. For instance, the moment I typed 'Implements IExternalApplication.OnShutdown', the skeleton code for two methods is automatically added by Visual Studio.</p>"
