    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>Answer\n\nIn the case you describe, the `Document.ProjectLocations` property will return only one single `ProjectLocation` element &ndash; it will hide the location named \"Project'.\n\nI have to explain a little bit about how Revit works internally here. A normal Revit model has two SiteLocations &ndash; one tied to the shared coordinates, and one tied to the project coordinates. Each one starts with one `ProjectLocation`. Those are the two ProjectLocations you mention &ndash; 'Internal' for the shared coordinates, and 'Project' for the project coordinates.\n\nThe API does not expose the project ones directly, because they are confusing and not particularly helpful for normal use, as you've seen.\n\nIf you created more ProjectLocations via the Location/Weather/Site dialog on the Manage tab, they'd share the same SiteLocation as the Internal location.\n\nAs far as coordinates are concerned &ndash; assuming you have a ProjectLocation `projLoc` and you execute the following:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ProjectPosition</span>&nbsp;pos&nbsp;=&nbsp;projLoc.GetProjectPosition(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">XYZ</span>.Zero&nbsp;);\n<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">TaskDialog</span>.Show(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;Revit&quot;</span>,&nbsp;pos.EastWest&nbsp;);\n</pre>\n\nThis will tell you the relationship between the project coordinates and shared coordinates when that location is active. For example, in the little test I did to check my understanding, it says 18, and my project base point is 18 feet east of my survey point.\n\nI don't know what the 'Project' ProjectLocation's coordinates mean in this circumstance, because it would be comparing to itself. Possibly it's a transform between Revit's internal origin and the project coordinates.\n\nIf `Document.ProjectLocations` does actually return both ProjectLocations in Revit 2016, you should simply ignore the 'Project' one. It's part of the project coordinates and isn't actually a ProjectLocation in the sense of the locations you see in Location/Weather/Site.\n\nThis information is given in terms of the 2018 API. It should mostly apply to Revit 2016 as well. I think the code internals are the same. You might need to make small trivial changes, such as use `get_ProjectPosition()` instead of `GetProjectPosition()` or similar.\n\nMany thanks to Diane Christoforo for this illuminating explanation!"
