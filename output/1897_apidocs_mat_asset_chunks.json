Clear, simple, A is B in the other environment.\n  There are a lot of consumers of the API now with no coding background as a result of things like Dynamo, PyRevit, and RhinoInside.\n  The fact that there isn't a easy to consume 1:1 mapping like this for our complex tool makes it difficult to do things easily and leads to a lot of rants. This is compounded by the go to resource of sharable API info (revitapidocs.com) having apparently fallen into a no-longer-maintained status.\n  The concepts we've been doing in depth technical write ups need to be simplified for this large cohort of users. It's a big ask, but would have a HUGE impact.\n  Alex Zhang  8 days ago\n  add @Joe Qiao to this thread.\n\n- 24x24 StackedItems\n  https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/24x24-stackeditems/m-p/10169950\n\n- drone driving film making to new heights, lengths, curves and other experiences\n  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-12/hollywood-drone-video-minnesota-bowling-alley/13241718\n\ntwitter:\n\nForge online training, RevitApiDocs update, Visual Materials API in Dynamo and 24x24 stacked ribbon items in the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon http://autode.sk/revitapidocs2021\n\nHere are some exciting Forge, Revit API and other topics for today\n&ndash; Forge online training in April 2021\n&ndash; RevitApiDocs support for Revit 2021\n&ndash; Welcome, AEC BIM Tools\n&ndash; Visual materials API in Dynamo\n&ndash; 24x24 stacked ribbon items\n&ndash; Innovative drone fly-through film...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nForge online training, RevitApiDocs update, Visual Materials API in Dynamo and 24x24 stacked ribbon items in the #RevitAPI\n\nhttp://autode.sk/revitapidocs2021\n\nHere are some exciting Forge, Revit API and other topics for today:\n\n- Forge online training in April 2021\n- RevitApiDocs support for Revit 2021\n- Welcome, AEC BIM Tools\n- Visual materials API in Dynamo\n- 24x24 stacked ribbon items\n- Innovative drone fly-through film...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\">\n<a href=\"\"></a>\n</p>\n</center>\n\n-->"
