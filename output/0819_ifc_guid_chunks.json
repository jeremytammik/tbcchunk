There's just a air terminal which is used to generate the GUID.\n\n<p>Using Revit's internal IFC export, GUIDs seems to be consistent as far I have noticed... \n\n<p>Hmmm...this is starting to be quite strange and frustrating...what I'm doing wrong?\n-->\n<p>The CreateProjectLevelGUID method also returns a different GUID in every run. \nI guess it should also be consistent, shouldn't it? \n\n<!-- avelez wrote: -->\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> After some investigation we now understand the source of the issue.  \nThe GUID generation routines have an internal cache that prevents duplicate GUIDs from being generated.  \nIn IFC, these functions are called once per element, and then a call to the ExporterIFCUtils.EndExportInternal method clears this cache for the next IFC export.  \nPlease note that the first time you call these routines, they have consistent values from previous sessions. \n<p>For now, there are two workarounds:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Only call the functions once per session, and store their values.\n<li>Call ExporterIFCUtils.EndExportInternal to reset the internal cache.\n</li></li></ol>\n<p>I would recommend #1 over #2, as the EndExportInternal call does more than just clear the cache, and may have unintended consequences.\n\n<!-- okat wrote: -->\n<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you very much for your explanation. \nIt makes perfectly sense now.\n\n<p>The workarounds you mention may solve this but have some drawbacks:\n\n<ul>\n<li>I can't use the EndExportInternal method because I'm not using the Revit IFC API and therefore I don't have access to an ExporterIFC object.\n<li>I don't want to start building my own cache, because it would not be 100% water proof, and who knows how much memory it would eventually consume with really huge projects.\n</li></li></ul>\n<p>Fortunately, there's a third workaround which I decided to implement. \nI combined the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/ifc-guid-algorithm-in-c.html\">\nIFC GUID representation algorithm</a> showing \n\nhow to construct an IFC GUID from a 'normal GUID' with the ExportUtils.GetExportId functionality, which produces a consistent GUID between runs.\n\n<p>Can you see any problems in this approach? \n\n<!-- avelez wrote: -->\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A couple of comments:\n\n<p>First of all, the approach you ended up using is the one that I was going to suggest (or close enough!)  \nYou should indeed go for that.  \n\n<p>Secondly, just to clear up one point, the Revit IFC API is part of the Revit API â€“ if you have the Revit API, you also have the Revit IFC API.  \n\n<!--\n\nThat said, you are correct that it isn't a good idea to misuse the API!\n\nHere are some other observations:\n\nThis information was also useful to solve the following question:\n\n07171219 [Export to IFC - GUID generation logic]\n\nC:\\a\\j\\adn\\case\\sfdc\\07171219\\ifc_guid.pdf\n\n-->\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> In another case, we are exporting models from Revit Architecture to IFC and observe that the GUIDs of some entities are not consistent, e.g. of IFCRelationship, IFCTypeObject and IFCPropertySetDefinition.\n\n<p>We are not making any changes to the model, just exporting it twice.\nStill, the exported IFC files contain different GUIDs generated for those entity types.  \n\n<p>The GUID for geometric entities like IFCDOOR, IFCWalllStantdardCase etc. do not change.  \n\n<p>What might be causing this behaviour?\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The algorithm for generating a consistent IfcGUID depends on the IFC entity in question having a constant and predictable relationship to a Revit element.  For something like an IFCDOOR, there is a one-to-one relationship between that and a Revit door element, so we can guarantee a consistent IfcGUID.  \n\nFor things like relationships, we either \n\n<ol>\n<li>Don't have a way to make this 1-1 relationship, \n<li>Don't have enough \u001cbits\u001d to make a GUID that is unique, or \n<li>Haven't come up with or implemented the algorithm yet.\n</li></li></li></ol>\n<!-- SPR 167219 covers some of these cases, and they cover the three options above. -->\n<p>For example, for IFCRELSPACEBOUNDARY, how do you uniquely define one or more connections between a room and a nearby wall? \nThis is an example of case 1.\n\n<p>For IFCPROPERTYSET, there is a mechanism in place for some elements that allows for a consistent GUID, so this is partially done and partially case 3.\n\n<p>IFCDOORSTYLE should be handled reliably.\n \n<!-- If the user can state which cases are particularly important and why, we can prioritize those cases, if it is possible at all. -->\n\nAs with most things in IFC, it is a combination of being able to do it and having time to do it.\n\n<!--\n\n<p>Besides, there was also some discussions on the IFC GUIDs in the Revit Beta forums which I am attaching with this email for your reference, as well.\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> \n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> \n\n<ul>\n<li>\n</ul>\n\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n\n<h4></h4>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n</pre>\n\n<a href=\"\">\n</a>\n\n-->\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
