Time to relax.\n</pre>\n<p>CouchDB is built not only for, but <b>of</b> the Web.\nIts design borrows heavily from web architecture and the concepts of resources, methods, and representations.\nData is self-contained:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Self-contained documents\" src=\"img/couchdb_01.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n</center>\n<p>Replication and backup is extremely simple, basically requiring no more than a modification of the base URL.</p>\n<p>CouchDB is implemented in the\n\n<a href=\"http://www.erlang.org\">\nErlang</a> programming\n\nlanguage, which is used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability with uses in telecommunication, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging.\nErlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.\n\n<p>Here is a\n\n<a href=\"http://couchapp.org/page/what-is-couchapp\">'what is' Q&amp;A</a>,\n\n<a href=\"http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-couchdb\">getting started tutorial</a> and\n\n<!-- <a href=\"http://docs.couchone.com\">documentation</a> -->\n\nfull 270-page O'Reilly textbook\n\n<a href=\"http://guide.couchdb.org\">\nCouchDB – The Definite Guide</a>.\n\n<p>The textbook samples make use of the\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL\">\ncURL</a> command line tool, e.g. the following two command line statements to create a new and list a database:\n\n<pre>\n  curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/baseball\n  {\"ok\":true}\n\n  curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/_all_dbs\n  [\"baseball\"]\n</pre>\n<a name=\"5\"></a>\n<h4>Relax – with IrisCouch</h4>\n<p>As I initially mentioned, the starting point of this exploration of mine was\n\n<a href=\"http://www.iriscouch.com\">\nIrisCouch</a>,\n\nwhich terms itself 'easy CouchDB'.\nIt provides a free hosting service, 'a couch in the cloud'.\nYou can sign up in minutes to have your own Apache CouchDB server.\n\n<p>For my purposes, I can install CouchDB on my local machine, develop my data repository locally, and push it all to the cloud by replicating my local database to IrisCouch and changing the base URL to use that for all interaction.\n\n\n<a name=\"6\"></a>\n<h4>Relax – with DreamSeat</h4>\n<p>While I explored the theory, my colleague\n\n<a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/philippe-leefsma.html\">\nPhilippe Leefsma</a> went\n\nahead and implemented a pair of .NET applications uploading and consuming cloud-based data from an IrisCouch-hosted CouchDB database using the\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/vdaron/DreamSeat\">\nDreamSeat</a> CouchDB .NET wrapper library.\n\n<p>Although the DreamSeat documentation boasts support for both complete synchronous and asynchronous API, Philippe used Visual Studio 2012 and its .NET 4.5 async support that automatically and transparently implements the entire support for async call-back.\n'Async' methods can use the 'await' keyword, so he wrote a couple of anync wrapper methods for standard synchronous DreamSeat calls.\n\n<p>Well, that provides lots of material to play with in the immediate future, and gives me hope of easily implementing my cloud-based data repository requirements.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of other more directly Revit API related notes:</p>\n<a name=\"7\"></a>\n<h4>ID and GUID in Revit Documents</h4>\n<!-- <p>Another note before closing:</p> -->\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> A short question about the way unique ID’s are managed in Revit.\nI want to export a large number of RVT models through DB link to a single database and I really need to have unique ID’s in my destination tables.\nSo far what I’ve seen is that the records pushed to my database have a field ID which seems to be unique within each Revit file, but not with my set of files.\n\n<p>So is there a way to have really unique identifier like a GUID instead of simple ID in my RVT models?\nOr at least is there a way to rely on a kind of GUID when we push data through DB link?</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Each Revit element has an ID property, its element id, which is unique within the RVT document, but not globally.\n\n<p>Each Revit element also has a UniqueId property, which is globally unique, unless you\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/titbits-of-the-week.html#2\">\ndo something to sabotage that</a>.\n\n<p>Under normal circumstances, the UniqueId should fulfil your needs.\n\n\n<a name=\"8\"></a>\n<h4>Visual Revit Programming with Dynamo</h4>\n<p>One last, final note before closing: if you are interested in a visual programming environment for Revit which allows non-programmers to create workflows to automate Revit functionality and geometry creation, be sure to check out\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ikeough/Dynamo\">\nDynamo</a>, also featured at\n\n<a
