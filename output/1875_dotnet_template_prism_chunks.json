    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"4\"></a> Revit Add-In Dotnet Template\n\nToday, I further delved into how to make my job easier; after having to develop sort of per-project new add-ins for the past 2 years, I got around to\ntrying [DotNet Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/custom-templates),\na new feature introduced in the dotnet tooling released with .NET Core and now available also with .NET 5.0.\n\nThe [HellPie.RevitTemplates GitHub repository](https://github.com/HellPie/HellPie.RevitTemplates) showcases\na Template Package which gets compiled to a NuGet package via `dotnet pack` and then installed as a Template Package using `dotnet new --install path/to/package.nuget`.\nThere is a prebuilt NuGet package in the Releases of the repository.\n\nThis one took me quite some time, but I got it to work making use of the very powerful templating system which allows optional and mandatory parameters to be collected upon running `dotnet new`.\nHelp is available through `dotnet new <template name> --help`.\nIt allows to configure a Visual Studio Solution with and without NUnit test projects (I did not get around to implementing deeper integration as I do not have experience automating Geberit's Revit Runner).\n\nThis project also uses the latest SDK-style Project files, which were also introduced with .NET Core but do allow specifying any kind of valid Target Framework, including any old (and new) version of .NET Framework.\nThe template even shows some documentation for which .NET Framework version should be used based on the desired target Revit version (defaults to Revit 2021 and .NET Framework 4.8, can be customized with the flags shown in `dotnet new revit-api --help`).\n\nHere is a screenshot showing the PowerShell help command output and a couple of example commands to run below:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/dotnet_new_help.png\" alt=\"Dotnet new help\" title=\"Dotnet new help\" width=\"600\"/> <!-- 1160 -->\n</center>\n\n- Create a new Solution with namespace Demo.Namespace targeting Revit 2019 and .NET Framework 4.8, without Unit Tests, without EditorConfig and without README and LICENSE files:\n<pre>\ndotnet new revit-api --name \"Demo.Namespace\" --AddInName \"Demo AddIn\" --AddInDescription \"AddIn Description for .addin File\" --VendorDescription \"Vendor (vendor@email)\" --VendorID \"example.vendor\" --Framework net4.8 --Revit 2019 --Tests=false --Repository=false --EditorConfig=false\n</pre>\n- Create a new Solution with default settings and only mandatory fields are defined:\n<pre>\ndotnet new revit-api --name Custom.Namespace --AddInName \"Demo AddIn\" --AddInDescription \"AddIn Description for .addin File\" --VendorDescription \"Vendor (vendor@email)\" --VendorID \"example.vendor\"\n</pre>\n- The same but using short flags:\n<pre>\ndotnet new revit-api -n Custom.Namespace -A \"Demo AddIn\" -Ad \"AddIn Description for .addin File\" -Ve \"Vendor (vendor@email)\" -V \"example.vendor\"\n</pre>\n\nPlease mention these two projects in one of your blog posts, not for the clout, but first and foremost to let people know about them, so that they can hopefully contribute improvements and changes (more templates and maybe better templates too).\n\nMany thanks to Diego for sharing his work, and good luck to all of us making use of and contributing to it!\n\nHave a nice day and a relaxing healthy weekend!"
