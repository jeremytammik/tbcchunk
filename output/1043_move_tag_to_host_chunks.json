You instead need to use the point returned by the TagHeadPosition property for the location of the tag.</p>\n<p>Then you can do something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  tag.Location.Move( hostLocation\n    - tag.TagHeadPosition )\n</pre>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1236248\">\nsdwil2k5</a> for\n\nconfirming and clarifying this.</p>\n</p>"
