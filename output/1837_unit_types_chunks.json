We think we have narrowed it down to a Revit change.\n \nWould you or someone be able to review this and let us know if it is a bug or feature?  Is there a published list of changes for other parameters that can review.\n \nWhen you export to a type “Family Types” in Revit 2012-2020 for PIPING__FLOW (GPM) you get for instance:\nCold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE\n \nWhen you do the same in Revit 2021, however you get:\nCold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE\n \nThe bad news being that Revit 2021 does not accept GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE Anymore, instead it expects (and does not ‘upconvert’) the new US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE.\nEg for 2000+ existing type catalogs this is a breaking change!!\n\n[A] I found this Jira:\nhttps://jira.autodesk.com/browse/REVIT-158981\n \nGLOB: Units INCHES_OF_WATER and GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE no longer work in Revit 2021 txt family type catalogs\n \nAccording to Jira, the change is intentional.  But probably upgrade from the previous verion is not working?\n\nThe change to the DB string is intentional. No upgrade from the previous version’s DB strings has been implemented.\n \nWe documented the changes in the [developer guide](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2021/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_html).\n\nA table of changes to database identifiers may be found at the bottom of the page\non [Introduction &gt; Application and Document &gt; Document Functions &gt; Units](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2021/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Application_and_Document_Units_html).\n\n\n- freecodecamp\n  [How to Style Your React Apps with Less Code Using Tailwind CSS and Styled Components](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-style-your-react-apps-with-less-code-using-tailwind-css-and-styled-components/)\n  [LockdownConf – A Free Online Conference to Help You Prepare for a Post-Pandemic World](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lockdownconf-free-developer-conference/)\n  [The Ultimate Python Beginner's Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-guide-for-beginners/)\n  [Learn Data Analysis with Python – A Free 4-Hour Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-data-analysis-with-python-course/)\n  \n\n- padlock url\n  https://www.whynopadlock.com/results/95468a2b-f094-45a4-9a74-4250a628cc09\n  why_no_padlock_test_results.png\nTEST RESULTS\nTest Information\n Tested URL https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/\n Test completed Tue, Apr 14, 2020 3:02 PM Eastern Time (GMT -5)\n Results URL https://www.whynopadlock.com/results/95468a2b‑f094‑45a4‑9a74‑4250a628cc09 \nSSL Connection - Pass\n SSL Certificate Info \nCertificate Issuer\nCOMODO CA Limited\nCertificate Type\nCOMODO ECC Domain Validation Secure Server CA 2\nIssued On\n2019-11-25\n Force HTTPS Your webserver is forcing the use of SSL.\n Valid Certificate Your SSL Certificate is installed correctly.\n Domain Matching Your SSL certificate matches your domain name!\nProtected Domains:\nssl919196.cloudflaressl.com\n*.typepad.com\ntypepad.com\n Signature Your SSL certificate is using a sha256 signature!\n Expiration Date Your SSL certificate is current.
