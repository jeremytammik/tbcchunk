    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Setting Plan View Location within Sheet\n\nMiroslav Schonauer, Solution Architect for Autodesk Consulting, has another interesting sample to share that shows a very powerful approach that is hopefully edifying and useful to many other add-in developers as well and also hits the limits:\n\nI have an interesting requirement to set each Plan View within Sheet (always that single view on it!) so that the *physical model* X-Y position is always the same among different sheets, regardless of the View/Viewport shape, crops, etc.\nThis is so that when multiple printed Sheets are 'overlapped', the Plans coordinate systems (physical XY position) are also overlapped…\n\nAfter a lot of research about the Sheet, Viewport and View classes, I thought I worked out how to do the task. For simplicity, I temporarily use single-sheet to test. In the code, I also made assumptions that the Sheet is active and that there are 'Level 0' Floor Plan (Master to which to align to) and several other Floor Plans (Slaves whose Viewports are to be moved), all of the same Scale.\n\nIt all works great apart when aligning the views which are cropped, BUT for some reason one of their Elevation symbols although outside the crop box STILL shows in the View. Strangely, it always seems to be East Elevation – if that one is left outside the crop box, it still shows in the Viewport, all others don't!\n\nTwo questions:\n\n- Is this a bug in UI that the Elevation Symbol shows in plan Viewport even though it's outside of the crop box?\n- Regardless of the answer to above, is there a way to adjust my code to cover that case as well? The problem is that I made hopefully reasonable assumption that the centre of View Outline is also the centre of Viewport (from my number-crunching analyses, Revit seems to add a 0.01ft buffer on all 4 sides to the former in order to create the latter), but that assumption is not valid when the elevation symbol outside the very cropped view is 'bundled' alongside that view in its sheet viewport L.\n\nThe code command is fully copied below and I attach a 2015 RVT model with walls used to write some sample text that can be used to repro the problem. The 'culprit' View is 'Level 1 View2' for which it can be seen that Elevation Symbols outside crop box is displayed. Other 2 views ('Level 0 Test1' and 'Level 1') align spot-on.\n\nBefore command:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/sheet_to_model_05.png\" alt=\"Before command\" width=\"960\"/>\n</center>\n\nAfter command:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/sheet_to_model_06.png\" alt=\"After command\" width=\"960\"/>\n</center>\n\nHere is the code I use to test this:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n[<span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>( <span class=\"teal\">TransactionMode</span>.Automatic )]\n<span class=\"blue\">public</span> <span class=\"blue\">class</span> <span class=\"teal\">CmdMiroTest2</span> : <span class=\"teal\">IExternalCommand</span>\n{\n&nbsp;
