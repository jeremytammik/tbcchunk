Optional updaters will not cause prompting the end user when they are opening a document that was modified by that updater but the updater is not currently registered. Optional updaters should be used only when necessary. By default, updaters are non-optional. New methods introduced to support this change are:</p><ul style=\"color:darkblue\">\n<li>UpdaterRegistry.SetIsUpdaterOptional(UpdaterId id, bool isOptional)</li>\n<li>UpdaterRegistry.RegisterUpdater(UpdaterId id, bool isOptional)</li>\n<li>UpdaterRegistry.RegisterUpdater(UpdaterId id, Document doc, bool isOptional)</li>\n</ul><p style=\"color:darkblue\">New methods were added to access information about currently registered updaters:</p><ul style=\"color:darkblue\">\n<li>UpdaterRegistry.GetRegisteredUpdaterInfos(Document doc)</li>\n<li>UpdaterRegistry.GetRegisteredUpdaterInfos()</li>\n</ul><p style=\"color:darkblue\">Revit now disallows any calls to UpdaterRegistry from within the Execute() method of an updater. That means any calls to RegistryUpdater(), AddTrigger(), etc. will now throw an exception. The only method of UpdaterRegistry allowed to be called during execution of an updater is UnregisterUpdater(,) but the updater to be unregistered must be not the one currently being executed.</p><p>That will not help you with old or existing models, though.</p><p>I tested the very simple and logical steps to\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/vsta-to-stay-and-updater-to-go.html#2\">\nremove an updater reference</a> on\n\nyour sample model and they worked absolutely fine for me:</p><ul>\n<li>Open the model in the user interface.</li>\n<li>Select 'continue working and do not warn me again'.</li>\n<li>Save and close the file.</li>\n</ul><p>When I reopen the file the next time, the warning is gone.</p><p>By the way, you always should disconnect your files from central before sending them to us for testing.</p><p>I see the following messages when opening your file:</p><ul>\n<li>1_central_model_msg.png</li>\n<li>2_missing_updater.png</li>\n<li>3_cannot_find_central.png</li>\n<li>4_save_not_synced.png</li>\n</ul><p>After performing the removal described above, the updater warning disappears.\nOn reopening again, I only see the 'cannot find central' message.</p><p>The developer responded:\n\"I tried it again and it didn’t work.\nThen I remembered your comment about detaching from central (sorry about that), did that and tried again.\nThen it worked.\"</p><p>Motto: disconnect from central to remove an updater.</p><a name=\"10\"></a>"

It is also records the timing and details of workflow information, such as the commands, tools, settings, and dialog boxes used during the workflow. Captured data is uploaded to the Chronicle website. An author can publish the Chronicle as public or private, so the desired user group can view a video of the workflow.
