The viewer currently supports over 60 widely accepted design and 3D file formats. One advantage of the View and Data API is that the viewer has access to the rich data embedded in the original design, including properties, parameters, inter-object relationships, materials, etc., and that models are streamed, so you can start interacting with a very large model without waiting for the entire file to be downloaded from the server.</p><p>APIs include a server-side REST API for uploading, translating and accessing your 3D models, and a client-side JavaScript API that allows fine control of the viewer itself, including:</p><ul>\n<li>Responding to events, e.g. selection and view changes.</li>\n<li>Searching and displaying the rich data included in the model.</li>\n<li>Manipulating the camera and view.</li>\n<li>Isolating and highlighting model components based on model data search.</li>\n<li>Loading 3D or 2D model representations.</li>\n<li>Linking 3D model objects to your own data sources.</li>\n</ul><p>Webinar details:</p><ul>\n<li>Date: Thursday, September 18, 2014</li>\n<li>Time: 8 a.m. PDT – 4 p.m. BST – 5 p.m. CET – 11 a.m. EDT</li>\n<li>Duration: approximately one hour</li>\n</ul><p>Registration: To reserve your place, send an email to\n\n<a href=\"mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com\">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a>.</p><p>Please make sure you include:</p><ul>\n<li>Your full name</li>\n<li>Company name</li>\n<li>ADN Developer ID, if available</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n</ul><p>We look forward to talking with you in the webcast.</p><p>If you would like to dive in right away instead of waiting for the webinar, you are welcome to apply for an API key at\n\n<a href=\"https://developer.autodesk.com\">developer.autodesk.com</a> and\n\nstart experimenting beforehand.\nNote that the API keys are still approved manually, so please be patient waiting for your approval.</p><a name=\"4\"></a>"
