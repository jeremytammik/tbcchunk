these items all felt a lot less urgent and important after immersing myself in a couple of days of vacation in Avignon to visit family and attend some offerings of one of the world's biggest theatre events, the annual \n\n<a href=\"http://www.festival-avignon.com\">\nAvignon theatre festival</a>, \n\nand especially its less official \n\n<a href=\"http://www.avignonleoff.com\">\n'OFF'</a>

href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/developer-center-and-sdk-update.html#0\">\ndeveloper guide wiki</a>.\n\nThe Revit Developer Center provides a host of self-learning material as well.\n\n<p>By the way, due to popular demand, a new lesson on debugging has been added to the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin\">My First Revit Plug-in</a> tutorial:\n\n<a

Special... &gt; HTML format to paste. \n</li></li></ul>\n<h5>b) Safer Two-step Approach via Word and RTF</h5>\n<p>You may have a still better result using Word in an intermediate step. \nIn that case, you don't even need to copy as HTML from VS; you can just use the standard copy. \nIn Word, first paste the code, then select and copy it again from Word. \nNow, in PowerPoint, use Home &gt; Paste &gt; Arrow down &gt; Paste Special... &gt; RTF format to paste it in.\n \n\n<h5>Colour Coded Source Code for Black Slides</h5>\n<p>If your slides use a black background, and you are using a white background in VS, your black source code will be invisible. In that case, in VS, you can go to Tools &gt; Options... &gt; Environment &gt; Fonts and Colors &gt; Item background and set that to black, set the item foreground to white, and hit OK.\n\n<p>Another option besides using CopySourceAsHtml is Notepad++, which supports many other languages, including JavaScript. \n\n\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<!-- 07348619 [Preview Control with linked doc] -->\n<h4>Preview Control with Linked Document</h4>\n<p>One if the new \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/revit-2013-and-its-api.html\">\nRevit 2013 API</a> features is the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/revit-2013-and-its-api.html#2\">\npreview control</a>, \n\nsupporting enhanced integration between Revit and an add-in.\n\n<p>I presented a minimal sample named \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/devcamp-day-two.html#23\">\nPreviewControlSimple</a> making \n\nuse of it in my DevCamp session on the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/devcamp-day-two.html#2\">\nRevit 2013 UI API enhancements</a>,\n\nand a more complete and complex one is given by the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/03/new-revit-2013-sdk-samples.html#4\">\nUIAPI Revit SDK sample</a>.\n\n<p>Here is a question that was not yet addressed, though:\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible to use the preview control with a linked document? \n\nI tried to do so, and it throws an exception saying \"Cannot preview a linked document\".\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is by design: a linked document cannot be previewed using this control.\n\n<p>One workaround would be to close the project document, open the linked document and preview it then.\n\n<p>Another would be to create a new view in your project, display the linked instance in it, hide all other instances, and send that view to the preview control.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"5\"></a>\n<!-- Steven Mycynek RE: #18 - calculate Revit element mass -->\n<h4>Calculating the Mass of a Building Element</h4>\n<p>And finally, another pretty fundamental little BIM question that has been hanging around waiting to be published for a while:\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I determine the mass of a building element?\n\n<p>I am working with data sets providing certain crucial calculation values based on material mass.\n\n<p>I can see how to calculate volume and area in the Revit API, but I see no API call to calculate mass.\n\n<p>Is there any way to calculate a Revit model element's material mass through the API? \n\n<!-- I've listed the various area's I've investigated at https://github.com/AMEE/revit/issues/18 -->\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can query the material for its density, and ask the building element for its volume.\n\n<p>The volume obviously needs to be provided for several different materials per building element, e.g. for the different layers of the compound structure of a complex wall or floor, so you can use the Category.HasMaterialQuantities property to check which materials contribute volume and the Element.GetMaterialVolume method to determine the volume of a specific material for a given element.\n\n<p>The density can be obtained from the Density property on StructuralAsset, which can be retrieved from Material.StructuralAssetId and PropertySetElement.GetStructuralAsset.\n\n<p>A related issue and a different access to the density in the context of \n\n<a href=\"http://www.amee.com\">\nAMEE</a> is \n\ndiscussed by David Laing in his thread on\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AMEE/revit/issues/18\">\ncalculating element material mass</a>.\n\n<!--\n\n<p>1.
