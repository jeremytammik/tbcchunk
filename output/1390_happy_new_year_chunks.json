If your application is successful, you will be invited to spend the week in our office working on your own projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs, with direct interactive help from the ADN DevTech team and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View & Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs.\n\nTo apply for this program, please submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you'd like to work on and how it will make use of the Autodesk Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available\nat [autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply). Note that that page has not yet been updated to include this latest event &ndash; that's how 'hot off the press' this announcement is &nbsp; :-)\n\nIf your application is successful, we will provide you with accommodation at an Autodesk designated hotel. All other travel and living costs are at your own expense.\n\nThe deadline for submitting proposals is January 31st 2016. We are looking forward to receiving your application. Good luck!\n\nThanks to [Stephen Preston](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/stephen-preston) for\nthe [original post](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2015/12/apply-to-attend-the-forge-accelerator.html)."
