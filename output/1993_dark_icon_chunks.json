(I was changing the icons in the ThemeChanged event.)\nI worked out I could embed the name within the `BitMapSource` when initially adding the image:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nPrivate Shared Function GetEmbeddedImage(ByVal assembly As Assembly, ByVal imageFullName As String) As BitmapSource\n  If Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(imageFullName) Then\n      Dim s As IO.Stream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(imageFullName)\n      If s IsNot Nothing Then\n          Dim bitmap As BitmapSource = BitmapFrame.Create(s)\n          Dim metadata As BitmapMetadata = New BitmapMetadata(\"png\")\n          metadata.SetQuery(\"/iTXt/Keyword\", imageFullName.ToCharArray())\n          Dim bitmapWithMetadata As BitmapSource = BitmapFrame.Create(bitmap, Nothing, metadata, Nothing)\n          Return bitmapWithMetadata\n      End If\n  End If\n  Return Nothing\nEnd Function\n</pre>\n\nI could then retrieve that name:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\nDim ribbonItem as RibbonItem...\nDim bitmapSource As BitmapSource = CType(ribbonItem.Image, BitmapSource)\nDim metadata As BitmapMetadata = CType(bitmapSource.Metadata, BitmapMetadata)\nIf metadata IsNot Nothing Then\n   Dim existingValue As Object = metadata.GetQuery(\"/iTXt/Keyword\")\n   Dim imageName As String = TryCast(existingValue, String)\n   'Use image name to get an embedded resource and set it to the ribbon item image.\nEnd If\n</pre>\n\nI hope this saves some of you a bit of time and effort.\n\nMany thanks to Matt for these valuable work- and time-savers!"

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> New NewFamilyInstance Overload\n\nKennan Chen provided a very clear explanation and solution\nfor [getting the wrong `NewFamilyInstance` override](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/getting-the-wrong-newfamilyinstance-override/m-p/11936658) using\n.NET Reflection or the C# `dynamic` keyword. In short:\n\nIn Revit 2024, the method you are using is defined in the `Autodesk.Revit.Creation.ItemFactoryBase` class and the `Autodesk.Revit.Creation.Document` class just inherits it.\nThis means that `ItemFactoryBase.NewFamilyInstance` is invoked underneath by the C# compiler generated code.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/kc_newfamilyinstance_moved.png\" alt=\"NewFamilyInstance moved\" title=\"NewFamilyInstance moved\" width=\"639\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 300 Pixel Width: 639 -->\n</center>\n\nIn previous versions of Revit, the \"same\" method is defined directly in `Autodesk.Revit.Creation.Document` class.\n\nThe Revit API news highlights this change in the section\n[1.4.1. Placement of Level based instances in family documents](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2024-api.html#4.1.4.1).\n\nThe use of the method looks the same, but they result in different compiled code when linked with different releases of RevitAPI.dll, which means the DLL compiled against Revit 2024 cannot be used in Revit 2023 if you use this method.\n\nThis is an API compatibility issue. The standard solution is to build different Revit add-in DLLs targeting the different versions of Revit.\n\nFor full details of this discussion, please refer to the original discussion thread\non [getting the wrong `NewFamilyInstance` override](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/getting-the-wrong-newfamilyinstance-override/m-p/11936658).\n\nMany thanks to Kennan for his research and explanation!"
