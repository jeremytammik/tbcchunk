XXX entries were omitted from the list\":\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/github_directory_truncated_1000.png\" alt=\"GitHub directory truncated to 1000 files\" width=\"505\">\n</center>\n\nWithout the 'a' subfolder, the README.md in the top level folder was hidden by all the blog posts and therefore not displayed.\n\nThe killer was that its contents were also not shown.\n\nI added `a` to hold the blog posts and left [README.md](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/README.md) in the top-level directory.\n\nA simpler issue occurred with images and attachments.\n\nThey live in the two subfolders `img` and `zip`, respectively, currently weighing in at 225 and 410 MB in total size.\n\nLuckily, all the individual image and attachment file sizes are smaller than 100 MB, or GitHub would refuse to host them at all.\n\nAs it is, I just got warning messages on two or three files that exceeded a threshold of 30 MB, but were still accepted.\n\nThe largest image file\nis the 77-MB [monitor_progress.gif](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/img/monitor_progress.gif),\nwhich is an animated GIF, i.e. a video screen recording, so not a still image at all.\n\nThe largest attachment is [track_changes.mp4](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/zip/track_changes.mp4),\nanother recording, 63 MB in size."
