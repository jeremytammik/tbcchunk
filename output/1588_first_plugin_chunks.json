If this is mentioned in the tutorial, it can reduce the number of questions asked.\n \n<b><u>Issue #2:</u></b> Unfamiliar Behaviour\n\nThe code does not properly copy the group. It just places it where you click, which could be in the middle of the other room. A more familiar way is to do a Copy-From:-To:. Only 3 lines of code including 2 modifications are required.\n \n<b><u>Modification #1:</u></b> Pick 2 points and calculate the distance between the two, instead of picking only 1 point.\n \nTo do so, replace the following code in the original lesson:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  //Pick a point\n  XYZ point = sel.PickPoint(\"Please pick a point to place group\");\n</pre>\n\nWith the following:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n  //Pick a point\n  XYZ pointFrom = sel.PickPoint(\"Pick a point to copy From\");\n  XYZ pointTo = sel.PickPoint(\"Pick a point to copy To\");\n  //Calculate the distance between the two points\n  XYZ ptDist = pointTo - pointFrom;\n</pre> \n \n<b><u>Modification #2:</u></b> Use the Copy method instead of Place\n \nReplace the following line between the `trans.Start` and `trans.Commit` lines:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n  doc.Create.PlaceGroup(point, group.GroupType);     \n</pre> \n \nWith this line:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n  ElementTransformUtils.CopyElement(doc, elem.Id, ptDist);\n</pre>\n\nFinally, a suggestion: the text seem to entice Revit users into programming. In this regard, I would consider doing the following:\n \nAdd Lesson 0 (or renumber the lessons): Implement the same code in a macro using the Edit / SharpDevelop IDE readily accessible from inside Revit, without going to Microsoft Visual Studio.\n \nThen Lesson 1 could become: *Now let's do this again by converting this macro into an add-in*.\n\nEver so many thanks to Elie for his constructive criticism and extremely helpful advice and suggestions!\n\nI passed it on to my colleagues for consideration next time the tutorial is re-recorded.\n \n\n####<a name=\"3\"></a>Getting Started with Web Programming &ndash; FreeCodeCamp \n\nBy the way, in case you are interested in getting started with web programming in addition to the desktop and .NET based Revit API, I can recommend the training sequence provided \nby [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) covering the following list of topics:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/freecodecamp_logo.png\" alt=\"freeCodeCamp\" width=\"263\"/>\n</center>\n\n- Front End Development Certification\n    - HTML5 and CSS\n    - Responsive Design with Bootstrap\n    - jQuery\n    - Basic Front End Development Projects\n    - Basic JavaScript\n    - Object Oriented and Functional Programming\n    - Basic Algorithm Scripting\n    - JSON APIs and Ajax\n    - Intermediate Front End Development Projects\n    - Intermediate Algorithm Scripting\n    - Advanced Algorithm Scripting\n    - Advanced Front End Development Projects\n    - Claim Your Front End Development Certificate\n- Data Visualization Certification\n    - Sass\n    - React\n    - React Projects\n    - D3\n    - Data Visualization Projects\n    - Claim Your Data Visualization Certificate\n- Back End Development Certification\n    - Automated Testing and Debugging\n    - Node.js and Express.js\n    - Git\n    - MongoDB\n    - API Projects\n    - Dynamic Web Application Projects\n    - Claim Your Back End Development Certificate\n- Video Challenges\n    - Computer Basics\n    - The DOM\n    - JavaScript Lingo\n    - Chrome Developer Tools\n    - Big O Notation\n    - Accessibility\n    - Agile\n    - Computer Science\n    - Data Visualization\n    - Embedded and Internet of Things\n    - Game Development\n    - Gamification\n    - Machine Learning\n    - Math for Programmers\n    - Mobile JavaScript Development\n    - DevOps\n    - Software Engineering Principles\n    - Statistics\n    - Tools\n    - User Experience Design\n    - Visual Design\n- Open Source for Good\n- Coding Interview Preparation\n    - Coding Interview Training\n    - Mock Interviews\n\nIf you are a complete beginner undecided what language to start with, the 11-minute video on [what programming language should I learn? Front-end? Back-end? Machine learning?](https://youtu.be/VqiEhZYmvKk) might help:\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VqiEhZYmvKk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\n\n####<a name=\"4\"></a>ModelessForm_ExternalEvent Initialisation\n \nBefore closing, let me mention another little hint resolving an issue encountered\nby [Aziz](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2043172) in \nthe [ModelessForm_ExternalEvent SDK sample](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/modelessform-externalevent-sdk-sample/m-p/7370034):\n\n**Question:** I am new to develop in Revit API getting started tutorials and all is going well until now, when I started with the SDK samples.\n \nI am just trying to implement the `ModelessForm_ExternalEvent` sample, but it keeps throwing me an exception stating that *Object reference not set to an instance of an object*.\n\n**Answer:** However, after more trials, I tried to change something and it did magically work. I created a class instance from but not assigning it a null value. I am sharing it below in case someone else is experiencing the same issue:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n  // class instance\n  Public static Application thisApp = new Application();\n</pre>"
