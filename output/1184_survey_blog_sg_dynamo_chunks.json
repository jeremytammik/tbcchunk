    "chunk_text": "<h4>Blogging Tips and Tricks</h4><p>Here are some basic tips and tricks that I consider essential for taking the first steps striving towards ultimate perfection in blogging:</p><ul>\n<li>Spell check your text before publishing, and proof read it, preferably several times over, and at least once before and once after publishing.\nI almost always notice new additional enhancement possibilities after publication.</li>\n<li>Ensure that all source code is well formatted and preferably colour coded.\nYou can use\n\n<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify\">google-code-prettify</a> for most languages.\n\nIt obviously cannot parse the .NET libraries referenced by VB or C# code, though.\nFor that, I use the J.T. Leigh <a href=\"http://copysourceashtml.codeplex.com/\">CopySourceAsHtml</a> utility inside my Visual Studio project environment.\nFor more details, please refer to various discussions of The Building Coder\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.36\">source code colourizer</a>.</li>\n<li>Image justification: place small images inline with the text as you please. Large images that take the major part of the column width are best centred.</li>\n<li>Strive for consistency.\nFor instance, if you have a paragraph marked 'Question:' and another marked 'Answer:', ensure that the two markers are formatted similarly.\nThey can either live on an own line each, or be prefixed to the paragraph they mark.\nThey can be either bold or not.\nJust ensure they are recognisably similar, to make the logical structure of your text as clear as possible.</li>\n<li>Do not mix fonts.</li>\n<li>If you mention any classes or methods, be absolutely sure they exist.\nFor instance, when talking about the Revit API FamilyType class, you should not make any mention of FamilyTypes.\nIf you need a plural, use normal words instead, e.g. 'family types'.</li>\n<li>Watch out for using special HTML characters.\nFor instance, the ampersand character '&amp;' has a special meaning in HTML.\nTo use it in your HTMP text, you have to escape it using the special HTML entity <code>&amp;amp;</code>.</li>\n<li>Use consistent capitalisation in your titles.</li>\n</ul><a name=\"4\"></a>"
