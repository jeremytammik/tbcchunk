which is used depends on their order in the definition of the RP.  \n\n<p>The RP is the only way to influence this selection, both in the UI and in the API.\n\n\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>I Beg to Differ</h4>\n<p>In some cases, the outer diameter of the fitting and the pipes may differ.\nThis is a content issue.  \nPipes and fittings are selected and connected based on the pipe 'Nominal Diameter' and the 'Nominal Diameter' of the fitting connector.  \nIn the Pipe Settings, a user can make the 'outer diameter' of a pipe bigger or smaller than its nominal diameter.  \n\n<p>Here is an example with the following pipe type properties:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Outer Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Inner Diameter 16 mm\n<li>Size 18 mm\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>The generic pipe elbow fitting connected to the pipes by calling the NewElbowFitting method has the following properties:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nominal Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Size 18 mm - 18 mm\n</li></li></ul>\n<!--\n<p>As far as Revit is concerned, these two fit together perfectly well.\nFrom a human point of view, however, a pipe with an *outer* diameter of 18 mm obviously does not fit with an elbow with a *nominal* diameter of 18 mm.\n-->\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Pipe and elbow diameters\" src=\"img/pipe_elbow_diameter_discrepancy.png\"/>\n</center>\n<p>For a fitting, the geometry of the elbow is completely arbitrary.  \n\n<p>If you would like the elbow and pipe to have the same outer diameter, there are two ways to achieve this:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make the outer diameter of the pipes bigger.  \n<li>Modify the geometry of the elbow to be smaller.  \n</li></li></ol>\n<p>Welded pipe fittings, for example, would have the same outer diameter, whereas threaded fittings, PVC, and others, typically have a larger outer diameter than the pipe itself, because the pipe engages into the fitting.\n\n\n<!--\n<p>Although the two pipes in the sample model are the same size, you may actually be requesting a reducing elbow where the inlet size and the outlet sizes are different? This should not be any problem at all.\n\n<p>When you call NewElbowFitting, it inspects the Pipe Type (not sure if it inspects that of Pipe1 or Pipe2, as it is conceivable they could be different), and then finds the first Elbow in the routing preference that 'works'.\n\n<p>As an example, if 'Elbow Reducing - Threaded - MI - Class 150.rfa' is in the routing preference, and you call this same method (which I suspect is very similar to using the 'Trim' tool in the UI) you will get an elbow that has different connection sizes (as per the image below/left.  If you don't have a transitioning elbow, but you do have a reducer defined, you will get a result as below/right. Note, however, that in your particular model file, your reducer is quite odd.  \n\n<p>In this case, both the Reducing Elbow and the Elbow + Reducer 'work', so which is used is dependent on their order in the definition in the RP.  As in the UI, in the API there is no way to influence this otherwise.\n\n<p>C:\\a\\j\\adn\\case\\sfdc\\07431217\\attach\\reducing_elbow.png \n\n<p>As for the fact that the outer diameter of the fitting and the pipes are different, this is indeed a content issue.  Pipes/fittings connected based on the Pipes 'Nominal Diameter', and the 'Nominal Diameter' of the fitting's connector.  In the Pipe Settings, a user can make the 'outer diameter' of a pipe bigger or smaller than its nominal.  Further, for a fitting, the geometry of the elbow is completely arbitrary.  So, there would be two ways to 'fix' the issue below... 1) make the outer diameter of the pipes bigger.  2) modify the geometry of the elbow to be smaller.  Welded pipe/fittings, for example, would have the same outer diameter... however, threaded fittings, PVC, and others, typically will have a larger outer diameter than the pipe itself (because the pipe engages into the fitting).\n\n<p>C:\\a\\j\\adn\\case\\sfdc\\07431217\\attach\\pipe_elbow_diameter_discrepancy.png\n-->\n<!-- 07448471 [Pipe Data] -->\n<a name=\"5\"></a>\n<h4>Change Elbow Dimension</h4>\n<p>Saikat handled an independent but related case that also happened to catch my attention:\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> \n\nHow can I change the diameter of an elbow pipe fitting, depending on the pipe diameter? \n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong> by Saikat Bhattacharya:\n\nTo test this, I created a pipe with an elbow fitting attached at one end. \nIn the user interface, you can see that the nominal diameter parameter of the pipe is disabled, i.e. greyed out.\nThe only thing I can do interactively in the user interface is modify the Nominal <b>Radius</b> of the pipe. \n\n<p>Based on this observation, I wrote the following few lines of code to modify the Nominal Radius of the selected elbow fitting using the API and it worked well:\n \n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span> uiApp = commandData.Application;\n  <span class=\"teal\">UIDocument</span> uiDoc = uiApp.ActiveUIDocument;\n  <span class=\"teal\">Document</span> doc = uiDoc.Document;\n \n  <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span> trans = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Transaction</span>( doc );\n  trans.Start( <span class=\"maroon\">\"Change Diameter\"</span> );\n  <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"teal\">Element</span> e <span class=\"blue\">in</span> uiDoc.Selection.Elements )\n  {\n    <span class=\"teal\">FamilyInstance</span> i = e <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">FamilyInstance</span>;\n \n    <span class=\"teal\">Parameter</span> p = i.get_Parameter( \n      <span class=\"maroon\">\"Nominal Radius\"</span> );\n \n    p.Set( 10 * 0.08333 );\n  }\n  trans.Commit();\n</pre>\n<p>For the complete solution and additional background information, please refer to Saikat's article on\n\n<a href=\"http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/07/changing-the-diameter-of-an-elbow-fitting-in-revit-mep-using-the-api.html\">\nchanging the diameter of an elbow fitting</a>.\n\n\n<!--\n<a name=\"2\"></a>\n\n<h4>Updated Revit MEP 2013 API Overview</h4>\n\n<p>In preparation for AU...\n\n<p>rme_api_ppt.pdf\n-->\n<!-- SPR #125677 [API Wish: executing external command programmatically] -->\n<a name=\"6\"></a>\n<h4>Invoke External Command on Start-up</h4>\n<p>Finally, to wrap this up, a little note on another issue that also cropped up and really is completely unrelated  :-)\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> I would like to call my Revit add-in in a batch operation in order to process multiple Revit files. \nThe process would involve starting Revit, loading a model, invoking my add-in, and shutting down the application afterwards. \nI don't see any obvious command line option to achieve this.\nIs it possible at all?\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. \nThis can be easily addressed by creating an external application, implementing appropriate OnStartup and DocumentOpened events, and driving the whole thing through a journal file or even directly from the command line.\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"\">\n</a>\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"

which is used depends on their order in the definition of the RP.  \n\n<p>The RP is the only way to influence this selection, both in the UI and in the API.\n\n\n<a name=\"4\"></a>\n<h4>I Beg to Differ</h4>\n<p>In some cases, the outer diameter of the fitting and the pipes may differ.\nThis is a content issue.  \nPipes and fittings are selected and connected based on the pipe 'Nominal Diameter' and the 'Nominal Diameter' of the fitting connector.  \nIn the Pipe Settings, a user can make the 'outer diameter' of a pipe bigger or smaller than its nominal diameter.  \n\n<p>Here is an example with the following pipe type properties:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Outer Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Inner Diameter 16 mm\n<li>Size 18 mm\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>The generic pipe elbow fitting connected to the pipes by calling the NewElbowFitting method has the following properties:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nominal Diameter 18 mm\n<li>Size 18 mm - 18 mm\n</li></li></ul>\n<!--\n<p>As far as Revit is concerned, these two fit together perfectly well.\nFrom a human point of view, however, a pipe with an *outer* diameter of 18 mm obviously does not fit with an elbow with a *nominal* diameter of 18 mm.\n-->\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Pipe and elbow diameters\" src=\"img/pipe_elbow_diameter_discrepancy.png\"/>\n</center>\n<p>For a fitting, the geometry of the elbow is completely arbitrary.  \n\n<p>If you would like the elbow and pipe to have the same outer diameter, there are two ways to achieve this:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make the outer diameter of the pipes bigger.  \n<li>Modify the geometry of the elbow to be smaller.  \n</li></li></ol>\n<p>Welded pipe fittings, for example, would have the same outer diameter, whereas threaded fittings, PVC, and others, typically have a larger outer diameter than the pipe itself, because the pipe engages into the fitting.\n\n\n<!--\n<p>Although the two pipes in the sample model are the same size, you may actually be requesting a reducing elbow where the inlet size and the outlet sizes are different? This should not be any problem at all.\n\n<p>When you call NewElbowFitting, it inspects the Pipe Type (not sure if it inspects that of Pipe1 or Pipe2, as it is conceivable they could be different), and then finds the first Elbow in the routing preference that 'works'.\n\n<p>As an example, if 'Elbow Reducing - Threaded - MI - Class 150.rfa' is in the routing preference, and you call this same method (which I suspect is very similar to using the 'Trim' tool in the UI) you will get an elbow that has different connection sizes (as per the image below/left.  If you don't have a transitioning elbow, but you do have a reducer defined, you will get a result as below/right. Note, however, that in your particular model file, your reducer is quite odd.  \n\n<p>In this case, both the Reducing Elbow and the Elbow + Reducer 'work', so which is used is dependent on their order in the definition in the RP.
