My thoughts are:\n1. The Autodesk Board of Directors is at fault for developing sales and acquisition strategies and not products. Watch this two-and-a-half-minute excerpt of an interview \nwith [Steve Jobs on the role of product and marketing](https://youtu.be/P4VBqTViEx4).\n2. If you as an architect are locked in by Autodesk, you have locked yourself in. No one is forcing you to buy Revit. If you did it old school and trained your entire staff in just one platform, you painted yourself into a corner with help from the Autodesk sales force.\n3. Unlike 15 years ago, there’s now a massive amount of AEC startups that solve both small and large issues on a multitude of platforms. I’m exited about what this can lead to long term. Kudos to the Dynamo and Grasshopper founders & communities for contributing to this change.\n\ntwitter:\n\nAutodesk joins the Open Design Alliance, discussion of the past and future of Revit, and some Bad Monkey reactions to the open letter with the #RevitAPI @AutodeskForge @AutodeskRevit #bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon http://bit.ly/quovadisrevit\n\nAn exciting announcement was made today;\nI add pointers to two preceding recent news items that may or may not be related\n&ndash; Autodesk joins Open Design Alliance\n&ndash; Martyn Day on the past and future of Revit\n&ndash; Håvard Vasshaug on the open letter...\n\nlinkedin:\n\nAutodesk joins the Open Design Alliance, discussion of the past and future of Revit, and some Bad Monkey reactions to the open letter with the #RevitAPI\n\nhttp://bit.ly/quovadisrevit\n\nAn exciting announcement was made today;\nI add pointers to two preceding recent news items that may or may not be related:\n\n- Autodesk joins Open Design Alliance\n- Martyn Day on the past and future of Revit\n- Håvard Vasshaug on the open letter...\n\n#bim #DynamoBim #ForgeDevCon #Revit #API #IFC #SDK #AI #VisualStudio #Autodesk #AEC #adsk\n\nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\"/>\n<p style=\"font-size: 80%; font-style:italic\"></p>\n</center>\n\n-->"
