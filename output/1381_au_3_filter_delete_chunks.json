I implemented the code as on GitHub. The problem appears in both Revit 2015 and 2016. I went through the code and the issue is in the temp delete...\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/spatial_element_geomatry_calculator_error_ah.jpg\" alt=\"SpatialElementGeometryCalculator error\" width=\"800\">\n</center>\n\nI was able to reproduce the issue on my system right out of the box:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/spatial_element_geomatry_calculator_error.png\" alt=\"SpatialElementGeometryCalculator error\" width=\"366\">\n</center>\n\nRead the error message. It tells you exactly what is going wrong:\n\n> The iterator cannot proceed due to changes made to the Element table in Revit's database (typically, this can be the result of an Element deletion) at Autodesk.Revit.DB.FilteredElementIterator.MoveNext...\n\nHere is the snippet of code causing the issue:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> roomCol = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">FilteredElementCollector</span>( doc )\n&nbsp; &nbsp; .OfClass( <span class=\"blue\">typeof</span>( <span class=\"teal\">SpatialElement</span> ) );\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"blue\">var</span> e <span class=\"blue\">in</span> roomCol )\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> room = e <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Room</span>;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( room == <span class=\"blue\">null</span> ) <span class=\"blue\">continue</span>;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( room.Location == <span class=\"blue\">null</span> ) <span class=\"blue\">continue</span>;\n</pre>\n\nThe error message does not appear until much later, though, when existing the code block encapsulating this snippet.\n\nFixing this problem is very easy: just extract the element ids from the collector and dispose of it before starting to loop over the results and potentially deleting things, e.g., like this:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> roomIds = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">FilteredElementCollector</span>( doc )\n&nbsp; &nbsp; .OfClass( <span class=\"blue\">typeof</span>( <span class=\"teal\">SpatialElement</span> ) )\n&nbsp; &nbsp; .ToElementIds();\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">foreach</span>( <span class=\"blue\">var</span> id <span class=\"blue\">in</span> roomIds )\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> room = doc.GetElement( id ) <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">Room</span>;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( room == <span class=\"blue\">null</span> ) <span class=\"blue\">continue</span>;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">if</span>( room.Location == <span class=\"blue\">null</span> ) <span class=\"blue\">continue</span>;\n</pre>\n\nPlease take note, Håkon &nbsp; :-)\n\nAccordingly, here is my updated [answer](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/findinserts-retrieves-all-openings-in-all-wall-types.html#comment-2391775373) to Arif's problem report:\n\n> Thank you for sitting down together with me at Autodesk University today and exploring this issue further.\n\n> First of all, by 'follow-up article', I actually meant this one on [wall area calculation handling multiple openings in multiple walls in multiple rooms](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/gross-and-net-wall-area-calculation-enhancement-and-events.html#6).\n\n> Another interesting take on this topic is using [IFCExportUtils to determine door and window area](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/ifcexportutils-methods-determine-door-and-window-area.html).\n\n> Secondly, we succeeded in finding and resolving the issue.\n\n> The fix is provided by the new [SpatialElementGeometryCalculator release 2015.0.0.4](https://github.com/jeremytammik/SpatialElementGeometryCalculator/releases/tag/2015.0.0.4).\n\n> The error was caused by deleting elements while iterating over them using a filtered element collector.\n\n> To fix, simply store the filtered element collector result as a list of element ids, close the collector, then iterate over the ids and optionally delete elements after the collector is closed.\n\nThank you again, Arif, for raising this issue!\n\nBy the way, the preferred method to submit a problem report on a GitHub sample is to raise a GitHub issue directly on the repository itself."

They also closely track the water consumed by the cows, because they realized that this metric can be used to accurately predict how much milk they’ll yield in the coming weeks, which can be combined with demand to predict market prices."
