If that is not possible, the Revit API will probably not be able to achieve it either.</li>\n<li>Create a minimal sample model at a point just before the targeted step and just after it has been achieved.</li>\n<li>Determine the exact differences between the two states of the model. What elements have been added, removed, modified, which properties are affected? This is where the element lister and RevitLookup come in handy, and other, more\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html\">\nintimate database exploration techniques</a>.</li>\n</ul><p>Now the question becomes how to achieve the same changes programmatically.</p><p>In this specific case, it may or may not be possible to modify the level associated with the group after it has been placed.</p><p>Please explore the issue a little along these and let us know the outcome so we can determine how to proceed from there.</p><p>If any problems remain to be resolved or a wish for new functionality needs to be raised, we will require a <a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#1b\">reproducible case</a> to understand, test and ensure the resolution.</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
