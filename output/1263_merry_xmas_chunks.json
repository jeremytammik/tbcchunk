So took the 3DS Max file and ran it through that. Quality is similar, but might be a little degraded… also, file size jumped I guess because there is only compression per frame in the GIF, rather than overall file.</p><p>Here is the result of learning how that works (you may need to click the image to see the animation):</p><center>\n<img alt=\"Kevin's Christmas tree\" src=\"img/xmas-2014-c-proj.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n</center><p>The tree in the video is a typical artificial tree.</p><p>Saving the planet, and completed my cloud learning.</p><p>Hahaha, HO, HO, HO!</p><a name=\"3\"></a>"
