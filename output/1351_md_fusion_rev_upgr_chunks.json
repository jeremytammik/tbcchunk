Solid modellers are great for knocking out quick forms, and really make short work of Boolean operations, bevels, chamfers and building complex components.\n\n> The problem with Solid modelling applications is that they are typically CAD/CAM, CAE tools not really meant for artists. One application is kind of changing that, and that is Autodesk’s Fusion 360. The application was built from the ground up to be an easy to use solid modeller for conceptual design, engineering, matching and sharing CAD content... using Autodesk’s Fusion 360 in a game art pipeline... get started with Fusion 360’s interface and tools... put together some game art assets... completely affordable... free for students, enthusiasts, hobbyists, and startups...\n\nMaybe you will discover that it is a powerful and useful tool for architects as well?"
