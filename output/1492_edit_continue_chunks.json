Load add-in project in Visual Studio.\n2. Compile/build DLL.\n3. Start Revit externally.\n4. In Visual Studio, click on Debug &gt; Attach to Process.\n5. Find and select the Revit.exe process in the list.\n6. Load the DLL-file through Add-In Manager in Revit (you will find Add-In Manager in the SDK).\n7. Click on the command you would like to debug and click Run.\n8. Debug your code.\n9. Stop debug.\n10. Fix your code and start from number 4 again.\n\nMichael published the [52-second video *DebugCommandWithoutRestartRevit*](https://youtu.be/I3NA2VUB8Hc) showing these steps live:\n\n<center>\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3NA2VUB8Hc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</center>\n\nThank you very much, Michael, for documenting and sharing this!"
