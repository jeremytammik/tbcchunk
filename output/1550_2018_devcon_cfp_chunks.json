Use `ProjectLocation.GetProjectPosition` instead.\n- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(48,33,48,61): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.SiteLocation` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetSiteLocation` instead.\n- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(79,33,79,61): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.SiteLocation` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetSiteLocation` instead.\n- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(163,17,163,57): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.get_ProjectPosition(XYZ)` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetProjectPosition` instead.\n- CmdSetTagType.cs(226,30,228,48): warning CS0618: `Document.NewTag(View, Element, bool, TagMode, TagOrientation, XYZ)` is obsolete: This method is deprecated in Revit 2018 and will be removed in a future version. Use `IndependentTag.Create` instead.\n- CmdGetMaterials.cs(248,48,248,62): warning CS0618: `AssetPropertyDoubleArray3d.Value` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `getValueAsDoubles` or `getValueAsXYZ` instead.\n- CmdGetMaterials.cs(254,48,254,62): warning CS0618: `AssetPropertyDoubleArray4d.Value` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `getValueAsDoubles` instead.\n\nI captured this state in [The Building Coder sample release 2018.0.132.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2018.0.132.0).\n\nLater, I fixed the trivial warnings:\n\n- `get_ProjectPosition` renamed to `GetProjectPosition`\n- replaced `ProjectLocation` `SiteLocation` property by `GetSiteLocation` method\n \nThese fixes have been applied in [release 2018.0.132.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2018.0.132.1).\n\nThree warnings remain to be sorted out, listed\nin [my migration notes](zip/tbc_samples_2018_migr_01.txt).\n\nThe asset related ones are explained in the section on *Asset API Changes* in the *changes and additions* document mentioned above.\n\nGood luck with your own add-in migrations!\n\nMeanwhile, looking a bit further ahead:"
