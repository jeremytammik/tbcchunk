    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>How to Debug a Complex Issue\n\nPeople frequently raise questions about some programming problem in their Revit add-ins and try to find help for that from others.\n\nThis help is often hard to provide due to the complexity of the issue.\n\nSuch a point arose again today in the Revit API discussion\non [API constraint management](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/api-constraint-management/td-p/6021191/jump-to/first-unread-message).\n\nHere is my recommendation on how to approach this, which I now also added as a post-post-scriptum to the [instructions for a reproducible test case](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#1b):\n\nI would love to dive in and try to help you debug this, but I am sorry to say I do not have the time.\n\nYou will have to continue exploring it yourself.\n\nAll I can suggest is to keep at it.\n\nOne approach to debugging a problem like this is:\n\n1. Simplify it down to something absolutely trivial and stupid that is guaranteed to work &ndash; dumb it down.\n2. Once that is working, add the required complications one by one until it either works completely or fails.\n\nOnce you have determined the exact point of failure, you can narrow that down further and create a <u>minimal</u> [reproducible case](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#1b).\n\nWith the minimal reproducible case in hand, I can either take a look myself of pass it on to the Revit development team for further analysis.\n\nThank you!\n\n**Addendum:** You might also want to read another example of how to handle this kind of issue that just came up in the Revit API discussion forum thread\non [using DMU to retrieve in-place mass reference level](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/retrive-in-place-mass-reference-level/m-p/6050735)."

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4\"></a>How to Ask a Question\n\nIn a related vein, I often receive requests by email or otherwise to solve a programming issue, or, in some cases, assess the possibility of implementing a programmatic solution for some given task.\n\nHere is my most recent reaction to such a request:\n\n- Ask a question on this in the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) instead of asking me directly.\n- Make sure that your issue is formulated in a generic way.\n- Strip out as much  complexity as possible. [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)!\n\nPosting an issue in public enables me to take a look at it, my colleagues as well, and the entire Revit developer community also.\n\nMy standard motivation blurb for goes like this:\n\n> I do nothing at all that cannot be shared and published, and share and publish absolutely everything I work on.\n\n> I therefore avoid discussing questions like this, and actually all questions whatsoever, one-on-one.\n\n> I prefer discussing everything in public and enabling the entire community to contribute and share.\n\n> That has several advantages. Among others, your peers can join in and help you, and our conversation becomes visible to others, to help them resolve their issues as well.\n\nIn addition to formulating a generic question and publishing it on the forum, a minimal [reproducible case](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#1b) can also help a lot.\n\nPut together an absolutely minimal example that clearly demonstrates the problem and also makes it easy to check whether a solution really achieves the desired result.\n\nThat will help people understand the issue better and motivate them much more to explore and chip in and help."
