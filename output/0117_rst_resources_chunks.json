AutoCAD is used to simulate the external analysis application. The data is exchanged between RST and AutoCAD using a custom XML format. Some RST properties are exposed in AutoCAD and stored in extended entity data. They can be edited manually in the AutoCAD Object Property Manager or OPM, and the updated data is read back in to Revit. Currently, only 'stick' elements are supported, i.e. structural framing elements such as columns, beams and braces. Here is an overview of the different RstLink modules:</p><ul>\n<li>RstLink: Helper DLL shared by both AutoCAD and Revit client.</li>\n<li>RSLinkRevitClient: Revit command implementation defining the two commands RSLinkImport and RSLinkExport.</li>\n<li>RSLinkRevitApp: Revit external application defining a user interface for the two commands.</li>\n<li>RSLinkAcadClient: AutoCAD.NET client defining the commands RSImport, RSExport and RSMakeMember.</li>\n<li>RSLinkAcadClientDynProps: Dynamic Revit properties for AutoCAD objects.</li>\n</ul><p>The enhanced detailing samples demonstrate:</p><ul>\n<li>Generation of a section and drafting view</li>\n<li>Creation of a sheet</li>\n<li>Import and export of external file formats</li>\n<li>Adding text, dimensioning and annotations</li>\n</ul><p>The enhanced standard Revit SDK samples are included in some of the the standard Revit SDK distribution samples:</p><ul>\n<li>CreateDimensions</li>\n<li>CreateViewSection: CreateDraftingView</li>\n<li>TagBeam: TagRebar, CreateText</li>\n</ul><p>Here is a list of the sample commands provided, extracted from my ADN samples text file, which is processed by RvtSamples to define entry points in the Revit 2009 menu:</p>"

In addition to the physical building information model\n(BIM) defined in Revit Architecture, RST defines an analytical model of the building, composed of geometry,\nloads, connectivity, release/boundary conditions, material properties, and other project parameters. This session\nshows how to implement a bi-directional link to a structural analysis program. We will then look at the\nreinforcement concrete detailing API and show how to automate part of the reinforcement workflow, eliminating\nrepetitive manual tasks. This session assumes basic knowledge of Revit programming.</p><ul>\n<li>Implement a Revit Structure add-in to export and import between the RST analytical model and an external analysis program.</li>\n<li>Implement an add-in that automates repetitive manual tasks in production of construction documents.</li>\n<li>Analyze, modify and create building model geometry, loads, connectivity, release and boundary conditions.</li>\n<li>Automatically drive the framing modelling, generate rebar, and extract rebar information.</li>\n<li>Programmatically generate section and drafting views and import and export DWG files, such as schedules.</li>\n<li>Create RST macros to add text, dimensions, and annotations.</li>\n</ul><p>The\n\n<a href=\"http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=class&amp;session_id=3136\">\nclass material</a>\n\nis publicly available from the Autodesk University web site and includes:</p><ul>\n<li>Handout document</li>\n<li>Powerpoint presentation</li>\n<li>Code samples</li>\n<li>Recording</li>\n</ul><a name=\"midaslink\"></a>"
