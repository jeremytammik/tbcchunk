    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> On Renaming a Shared Parameter\n\nJay Merlan very kindly shared some insights on renaming shared parameters in his recent article\non [True or False: Shared Parameters Can Be Renamed](https://opendefinery.com/blog/revit-shared-parameters-can-be-renamed).\n\nAs I pointed out in [my comment](https://opendefinery.com/blog/revit-shared-parameters-can-be-renamed/#comment-5072357426) on that post, the Revit development team discussed Jay's suggestions internally and say:\n\nMy perception is that we don't support renaming a shared parameter after loading into a project or a family.\n\nWe are discussing support for such a feature of 'unified parameters' in a future release of Revit.\n\nJay's article above explains very well why Revit customers want to rename them, and that is really helpful.\n\nThe steps above work well to generate a new family with the new name, and the references, like formulas within the family, are updated to the new name. But, when I try to load it to an existing project with old name parameters, it will be renamed back. That makes sense and that is how this workaround works. So, it only works for the projects and models without using the old parameters.\n\nThe fundamental problem with the current Revit implementation of shared params is the fundamental question: what does it mean to 'rename' a parameter?\n\nOnce the parameter definition `.txt` file has been consumed by Revit, you can rename a parameter in the `.txt` file all you like, regardless of what Revit considers correct. But, all docs where this file has already been consumed will have no idea of the new name. Which will clearly result in a mess, as the same parameter will appear under different names spread all over various projects and families.\n\nIn cases when two incarnations of the same parameter need to be merged (because it is the same parameter, after all), one incarnation will magically change its name &ndash; like in the Load Family case.\n\nAs far as we can tell, a problem like this can only be solved via some 'central source of truth', like a cloud-something."
