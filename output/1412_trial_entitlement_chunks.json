It does not track the usage.\nYou would have to implement your own service to track usage.\n\nI assume that the scenario you wish to avoid is one single user, John, running the app from several different computers at the same time.\nTo prevent that, you can use a floating license schema, like this:\n\nJohn starts the app on computer A:\n\n- You check the entitlement.\n- You log a record on your website noting that computer A is currently using the license, e.g. storing its IP address, the time stamp, the license, etc.\n- Every N minutes, refresh the record on your website.\n    - Lock the app if the Internet connection is lost.\n- When John shuts down the app, inform your website and release the 'currently using' record for computer A.\n\nIf John starts the app on computer B, you proceed similarly, but:\n\n- If your website says 'license already in use', give a grace period of N minutes.\n- N minutes later:\n    - If the record for computer A gets updated, lock the app on Computer B.\n    - If the record for computer A does not get updated for some reason, e.g. crashed, give another N minutes grace period.\n- N minutes later still: if there is still no change, take the license, and revoke it for computer A, which will lock down from now on.\n\nIf more than two computers are playing in this game, you may decide on stronger rules, set a priority on who can take the license, etc.\n\nSo, you need to implement your own solution to handle simultaneous use of the app on multiple machines.\n\nFor information on the current implantation entitlement API implementation, please refer to the following material &ndash; it is general in nature and thus holds good for Revit also:\n\n- [Entitlement API recording](https://autodesk.box.com/s/aj41r4y9inou6hh3mps2ri8stz9nelt1)\n- [Sample application source code](https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/EntitlementAPI)\n- [Implementing copy protection in your apps](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=24243607)\n- [Entitlement API for desktop apps](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=24243865)\n\nI mentioned some additional resources in the recent discussion of the [Autodesk reorganisation and Kean's move to Octo](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/02/reorg-fomt-devcon-ted-qr-custom-exporter-quality.html#2):\n\n- [Entitlement API for Revit Exchange Store Apps](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2015/04/entitlement-api-for-revit-exchange-store-apps.html)\n- [Exchange Apps resources &ndash; Entitlement API information](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/exchange-apps-webinar-recording-and-resources.html#3)\n- [Securing your AutoCAD app using .NET](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/02/securing-your-autocad-app-using-net.html) &ndash; Kean's sample showing how to use a REST API to check the user entitlement for your application via the Autodesk AppStore.\n\nI hope that this helps and provides a final, complete and comprehensive overview."
