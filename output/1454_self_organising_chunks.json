Die Vorteile sind mannigfach und reichen von der automatischen Generierung einer Vielzahl von Designs über deren ideale Integration in die gebaute Umgebung, deren strukturelle und automatisierte Optimierung bis zur dynamischen Adaptivität über lange Zeiträume. Motiviert durch neuste Erkenntnisse aus der Natur über die Konstruktionsweisen sozialer Insekten, werden in diesem Projekt Softwareansätze aufgezeigt, wie man Selbstorganisation in den Designprozess von Architektur einfließen lassen kann. Die wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten des Hauptreferenten umfassen beispielsweise das Design und die Optimierung selbstorganisierender Softwareagenten und deren produzierte Artefakte. Ein entsprechender programmatischer Ansatz zur selbstorganisierten Konstruktion wird vorgestellt, der die API des Revit 2016 Softwareframeworks nutzt.\n\n<!-- \nInnovations in software, robotics and 3D printing ruecken self-organization as a planning and design approach in tangible proximity. The advantages are manifold, ranging from the automatic generation liking by their perfect integration in the built environment, whose structural and automated optimization to dynamic adaptivity for long periods. Motivated by the latest findings from nature about the construction methods of social insects, Softwareansaetze be shown how to make self-organization incorporated in the design process of architecture in this project. The scientific work of the keynote speakers include, for example, the design and optimization of self-organizing software agents and their produced artifacts. A corresponding programmatic approach to self-assembled structure is presented, which uses the API of Revit 2016 software frameworks.\n-->\n\n*Innovations in software, robotics and 3D printing enable self-organization as a feasible planning and design approach with many advantages, ranging from the automatic generation of huge numbers of designs to their perfect integration into the built environment, their structural and automated optimization, all the way to dynamic adaptivity over long periods of time.

We present a corresponding programmatic approach to self-assembled construction using the Revit API.*\n\nThat sounds pretty exciting to me.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/ant.jpg\" alt=\"Ant\" width=\"246\">\n</center>"

    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"6\"></a>Two Different Energy Model Types\n\nThis question has come up repeatedly in the past, so it is worthwhile pointing out again.\n\nBy default, the energy analysis is performed on rooms or spaces and treats their boundaries as vertical.\n\nThis is inappropriate in buildings using free-form geometry.\n\nTherefore, a second setting was introduced in Revit 2016, so that we now have two different Energy Model Types: surface versus [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel).\n\nCalculations are based either on the 2D plan surface views or by filling the entire building volumes with voxels, little sugar cubes.\n\nThe two different options are selected by settings in the `EnergyAnalysisDetailModelOptions` to base calculations either on spatial elements &ndash; i.e., rooms and spaces, assuming vertical boundaries &ndash; or bounded by actual building elements &ndash; i.e., floors, walls and ceilings, which may be arbitrarily shaped.\n\nFor more detail, please refer\nto [What's New in the Revit 2016 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html),\n[Energy Analysis and gbXML API changes](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.06):\n\n`EnergyModelType`\n\n- SpatialElement &ndash; Energy model based on rooms or spaces. This is the default for calls when this option is not set, and matches the behaviour prior to Revit 2016.\n- BuildingElement &ndash; Energy model based on analysis of building element volumes."
