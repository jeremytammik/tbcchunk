    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"2\"></a>Idling and external events, DMU and DocumentChanged\n\nWe have repeatedly compared the various ways of reacting to Revit model changes, e.g. in the discussion on [DocumentChanged versus Dynamic Model Updater](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/documentchanged-versus-dynamic-model-updater.html).\n\nLet's take a fresh look at this, with some important input once again from Arnošt Löbel:\n\n**Question:** Is there any way to quickly retrieve an `ApplicationServices.Application` object when I don't have a Document to work with? I don't see a way to it in the `OnStartUp` event such that I could just cache it somewhere. I also assume using the following is bad:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> app = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">Application</span>();\n</pre>\n\nOften this is the case when I'm in an Idling event handler but not always. I need the application in order to get at the DocumentSet via Application.Documents.\n\n**Answer:** If you are in an Idling event handler, are you sure that is the right place to be?\n\nI recommend avoiding the Idling event in preference of external events, if you are using it to interact with the outside world.\n\nThe only time I think an Idling event is more useful than an external event is when you want it to be called immediately and once only, e.g., because you are in a situation in which you would like to start a transaction to modify the document and cannot do so right away.\n\nAnyway, apart from that: if you indeed are inside an Idling event handler, you do in fact have extremely easy and direct access to the Application object.\n\nThe `sender` argument of various events, such as `ApplicationInitialized` and `Idling`, provide the UIApplication object to you straight away:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">private</span> <span class=\"blue\">void</span> OnIdling(\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">object</span> sender,\n&nbsp; &nbsp; IdlingEventArgs e )\n&nbsp; {\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"blue\">var</span> uiApp = sender <span class=\"blue\">as</span> <span class=\"teal\">UIApplication</span>;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class=\"green\">// . . .</span>\n&nbsp; }\n</pre>\n\n**Response:** Thanks for the info. My code is from previous versions of Revit where external events did not exist (I think) and that's why I was using the Idling event. I'll give these IExternalEventHandler classes a go and test it out.\n\nMeanwhile can you confirm this is an acceptable workflow:\n\n1. Create an IUpdater and set it trigger when a parameter value has changed.\n2. When IUpdater.Execute is called and I need to make changes a Document I then invoke ExternalEvent.Create(IExternalEventHandler).\n3. Inside of the IExternalEventHandler.Execute method, I create transactions and make more changes to the Document. This will not trigger the IUpdater to fire again.\n\nLast time I remember transactions were not permitted inside of IUpdater.Execute. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, your workflow looks pretty OK to me.\n\nYes, you cannot start a new transaction inside the updater Execute method, because that is executed inside the already running transaction that triggered the updater in the first place.\n\nFor that usage, I would assume that a one-off Idling event handler is almost exactly equivalent to an external event, so you can use either.\n\n**Answer from Arnošt:** Sorry, Jeremy, I have to chime in.\n\nThis workflow actually does not look good to me. Although it is possible to do it that way, it is neither an efficient way nor the safest way. You already hinted the solution in your second statement, though; that one is correct: If you need to make changes (as a reaction to model changes that triggered the updater), you should make them right there in the IUpdater.Execute method. It is possible because the model is already in a transaction and thus is open for changes made by external applications.\n\nIn the suggested workflow, the biggest problem I see (beside that it is rather inefficient) is that the new transaction will be separated from the transaction that triggered the updater. That is wrong and dangerous. The danger is in the possibility that the end user undoes one transaction but leaves the other one in which the updater run. That would leave the document in a state where changes were made to which you wanted to react, but the reaction (in the second transaction) is removed. From the point of view of the application the model would thus be invalid and corrupt.\n\n**Response:** I agree there's danger although very limited. Let me explain what I'm trying to do and maybe you can direct me to the most efficient process.\n\nI have 4 generic annotation families. I need to track all instances of these families, by their corresponding View, in our external database. Our database is not tracking individual instances of the generic annotations, just overall counts, by part number, per view and cannot be changed. So the events I need to capture from Revit are:\n\n* When these annotation instances are created\n* When these annotation instances are modified\n* When these annotation instances are deleted\n* Transaction is undone/redone\n\nWhen any of these events occur I need launch a synchronization event which does the following:\n\n* Delete the existing bill of materials (model group) in the corresponding View\n* Validate the parameters of generic annotation instance in that View (if they are invalid I need to delete those instances)\n* Upload the new data to the external database\n* Recreate the bill of materials table (model group)\n\nI'm using a model group with detail lines and text for the table. To be efficient, I only want to execute a synchronization event once per View.\n\nThe IUpdaters are good, however I haven't found a way for them to tell me what View the deleted element ids came from. I'm starting to question whether I should just do everything in the DocumentSaved events rather than bothering with the IUpdaters. I'm open to suggestions if you feel otherwise.\n\n**Answer:** I agree that you are up to a challenge. Tracking deleted elements is never easy because one cannot get any properties of the elements from Revit. It is not because Revit does not want to give them; we do not have them either in the internal model database. Or rather, we do have them still in some form (for eventual undoing), but it is dangerous accessing them, for they have been disconnected from the rest of the model. This is an internal implementation detail, of course; the point is that one cannot get any info for deleted elements other than the elements' Ids.\n\nYou have two choices, the way I see it. Either you have to store more info in your database, or you try a different approach altogether. You suggested performing a synchronization only once when saving a (modified) file. If that is a viable approach for your needs, I would recommend it over the Updater approach.\n\nThere is one other thing also suggesting against the use of an updater, and it is also quite important one. You mentioned that: \"I need to track all instances of these families, by their corresponding View, in our external database\". If that is what I think it is, you should not use updaters at all for the purpose of syncing with the database. It is because updaters are called for new changes only; they are never called for undone or redone transactions, which is a huge problem for external tracking. It means that - in your case - if any creation of the annotations are undone, your database will not have correct records. Therefore, when there is a need for a sync between elements in a Revit model and external databases, the programmer must use the DocumentChanged event. The rule is as follow:\n\n- If an app needs to react to model changes by making further changes to the same modes, then an Updater is the way to go.\n- If an app needs to react to model changes by making changes to external data, then the DocumentChanged must be used.\n\nHowever, the DocumentChanged event suffers from the same problem: one cannot get any data about already deleted elements. Sorry about that.\n\nGood luck!"

You have to write it manually by adding a call to `doc.Regenerate` between the calls to `NewFloor` and `NewOpening`. This will reflect the latest changes to the model and therefore the `NewOpening` method will work nicely.\n\nThank you very much, Amr, for discovering this the hard way and sharing it with us."
