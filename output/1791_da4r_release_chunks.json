This Forge service also enables connections of tools and tasks into complete workflows. Previously available for AutoCAD, you can now also automate tasks in 3ds Max, Inventor, and Revit.\n\nIf you want to learn about this API directly from the beta testers and experts, grab a ticket to Forge DevCon at Autodesk University to attend classes on November 18 in Las Vegas. Tickets are only $150 and you can register or add it to your AU pass today.\n\n<center>\n[Register here for Forge DevCon](https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/portal/contactInfo.ww?timedOut=true&pass=forgeDevCon)\n</center>\n\nPlease refer to the full announcement\non [Design Automation API for Revit, Inventor and 3ds Max to release on October 28](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/design-automation-api-revit-inventor-3ds-max-release-october-28) in\nthe Forge community blog to read more about this, see the features for other products besides Revit, and, above all, hear the recordings of four beta testers from ImaginIT, InsiteVR, Affiliated Engineers and CADD Microsystems describing their experiences and achievements working with this API through its beta phase.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/da4_3ds_i_r.jpg\" alt=\"Design Automation API for 3DS, Inventor and Revit\" width=\"300\">\n</center>"
