let's get down to it right away.\"\nI was not that brave, but when he brought up the topic again in January, I was finally ready for it:</p>\n<center>\n<img alt=\"Shaving Jeremy's head\" src=\"/p/2012/2012-01-12_haircut_shave_head/haircut-small.gif\"/>\n</center>\n<p>His friend Naomi took pictures of the process and Christopher made an animated GIF from them.\n\n<p>I had associated many things with it, such as letting go, clearing up, connecting to the spiritual, getting lighter, accessing my own embedded resources etc...\nIt was a good feeling  :-)\n\n<p>Anyway, today is the day for\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_on_a_Jet_Plane\">\nleaving, on a jet plane</a>\n\n(<a href=\"http://www.lyrics007.com/John%20Denver%20Lyrics/Leaving%20on%20a%20Jet%20Plane%20Lyrics.html\">lyrics</a>),\n\nfor the\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cvent.com/events/devcamp-2012/event-summary-56817a3b57614f8eb59ea05fcd59bc32.aspx\">\nAEC DevCamp</a>\n\nin Boston.\n\n<p>Here is one last little not-so-spiritual and rather down-to-earth Revit API item before I pack and go.\n\n<p>Ah, no, yet one more intersting thing to point out that you should not miss: one of the \"rarest of predictable celestial phenomena\" is taking place tomorrow, June 5: a\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_2012\">\ntransit of Venus in front of the sun</a>.\n\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you please provide some insight and sample code on how to retrieve an image from the resources embedded in a DLL?\n\n<p>I am writing an add-in that creates its own Revit ribbon.\n\n<p>I can access image files stored in separate external files without any problems, but I would like to deploy a single DLL without having to include a folder full of images.\n\n<p>Thank you very much!\n\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please take a look at the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/string-search-adn-plugin-of-the-month.html\">\nString Search ADN Plugin of the Month</a>.\n\nIt demonstrates exactly what you are asking for.\n\n<p>The method that is probably of greatest interest to you is the NewBitmapImage one in the external application implementation class App:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> </span><span class=\"gray\">&lt;summary&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> Load a new icon bitmap from embedded resources.</span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> For the BitmapImage, make sure you reference </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> WindowsBase and PresentationCore, and import </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> the System.Windows.Media.Imaging namespace. </span>\n  <span class=\"gray\">///</span><span class=\"green\"> </span><span class=\"gray\">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"teal\">BitmapImage</span> NewBitmapImage(\n    <span class=\"teal\">Assembly</span> a,\n    <span class=\"blue\">string</span> imageName )\n  {\n    <span class=\"green\">// to read from an external file:</span>\n    <span class=\"green\">//return new BitmapImage( new Uri(</span>\n    <span class=\"green\">//  Path.Combine( _imageFolder, imageName ) ) );</span>\n \n    <span class=\"teal\">Stream</span> s = a.GetManifestResourceStream(\n        _namespace_prefix + imageName );\n \n    <span class=\"teal\">BitmapImage</span> img = <span class=\"blue\">new</span> <span class=\"teal\">BitmapImage</span>();\n \n    img.BeginInit();\n    img.StreamSource = s;\n    img.EndInit();\n \n    <span class=\"blue\">return</span> img;\n  }\n</pre>\n<p>It is used like this in to populate the push button image data:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  d.Image = NewBitmapImage( exe, <span class=\"maroon\">\"Img1.png\"</span> );\n  d.LargeImage = NewBitmapImage( exe, <span class=\"maroon\">\"Img2.png\"</span> );\n  d.ToolTipImage = NewBitmapImage( exe, <span class=\"maroon\">\"Img3.png\"</span> );\n</pre>\n<p>Obviously the images have to be included in the project files and marked as embedded resources in the Visual Studio IDE, and the path within the project has to match.\n\n<p>All of that is demonstrated by the StringSearch sample.\n\n\n<p>Actually, since I was working on it recently anyway, here is an\n\n<a href=\"file:///C:/a/src/revit/plugin/string_search/zip/StringSearch2013.zip\">\nupdated version of the source code for Revit 2013</a>,\n\nincluding the entire Visual Studio solution and add-in manifest.\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
