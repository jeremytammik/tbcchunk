    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"5\"></a>Discussion\n\nHere is a summary of the discussion leading up to this.\n\nIt provides some interesting insight into all the work, research and collaboration required for this implementation.\n\n**Question:** We have a need to report the project parameters that are defined in a project, as part of a Quality Assurance tool on which we are working.\n\nWhile Revit apparently won't let you create two (non-shared) project parameters with the same, case-sensitive name, for some reason it WILL let you add two Shared Parameters with identical, case-sensitive names provided they have each have different GUIDs.\n\nEach of those parameters may be of the same or different types, in the same or different groups, and associated with the same or different categories.  So yes, you could have two parameters with identical names appear in the same group of the properties pane for an element, right next to each other.\n\nSo for us to accurately report the project parameters that are defined, we have to differentiate between the two definitions.  However, those definitions may be identical with the only difference (we can tell) being the shared parameter GUIDs.\n\nBut there doesn't seem to be a way to ask for the GUID of a project parameter with the API, not even when we try to resort to using Reflection.  Every time we try casting the DefinitionBiningMapIterator.Key to ExternalDefinition we get null, even for parameters we know by testing are shared.  It always casts to InternalDefinition, but never to ExternalDefinition.  So not only can we not seem to get the GUID, there doesn't seem to be a way to even tell if it's a shared parameter or not in the first place.\n\nWhat are we missing?  Is there some other API methods we simply haven't found yet to get this information?  How can we accurately report how the project parameters were defined by the user in the GUI?\n\nThanks very much for any assistance you can provide.\n\n\n**Answer:** Parameter.GUID is the property you seek. Armed with the correct GUID from the shared parameters text file you can verify that the correct parameter is found. Be sure to test the Parameter.IsShared property before accessing the GUID property as non-shared parameters will throw an exception.\n\nThat works for shared parameters, if you are looking for a non-shared project parameter then I guess you could filter out all shared ones of the same name, with the remaining non-shared one being your target.\n\n**Response:** Yes, that is how we do it for regular Element parameters.\n\nBut have you actually tried this on project parameters?  To the best of my knowledge project parameters do not inherit from the Parmeter class. I believe they are a very different beast, I think in part because they can be associated with one or more categories, which regular Parameter objects don't do.\n\nFor brief example, it is my understanding that accessing project parameters starts with the document `ParameterBindings` property, leading to `Definition` instances.\n\nNone of the properties on the Definition object are of type Parameter, nor can they seem to cast to a Parameter object, unless I'm missing something.\n\nFurther, there is absolutely no guarantee that the current shared parameters file (if any) was used to provide the shared parameters to the project parameters.  Imagine, for example, you are an outside party who got the project file from the architect and you don't have their shared parameters file, or the correct one or more of the many shared parameters files they may be using.  WORSE, what if a different shared parameters file is currently being used and it has a shared parameter in it with the same name and other properties but a different GUID?  We'd wind up reporting the wrong shared parameter definition being used in the project, which violates the requirements.\n\nUnless you can guarantee an extremely well controlled environment (we can't), you should never assume the definitions in a shared parameters file were the ones actually used in a project.\n\nAlso, a shared parameters file can't have two parameters with the exact same case-sensitive name in it, whereas the project parameters list CAN have two or more parameters with the exact same case-sensitive name in it, provided they were shared parameters and had different GUIDs.  We've actually seen this in one of our customers projects, which is where the need to accurately report this information came from.  So we really have a need to get the actual GUID being used inside the Revit project for the project parameter definition so we can properly report what is going on, and where things came from.\n\nWhile I greatly appreciate the effort (thanks!), I can't find a way to reliably apply anything you've suggested.\n\nIf you can provide a snippet of code that works reliably on project parameters, I would be hugely grateful.\n\nThanks again.\n\n**Answer:** Ok, I've been meaning to do something like this for a while now so I just knocked up a quick demo of how to get a complete list of both project and shared parameters used within a document. It's a little crude but it'll do the job.\n\nIt basically analyses the parameters of every element within a document and generates a list of unique parameters found and categorises them into shared or project parameters. It also appends the GUID as a hex string to the end of all shared parameter names. If you run it on a document that has multiple parameters with the same name (Both shared and project) you will see that it identifies each individually.\n\n... sample code...\n\nAs you can see, there is no need to be messing with binding maps as all the data you need is found within the parameters attached to the elements. There isn't any way to get the GUID for the project parameters, but as you have already noted, each project parameter must have a unique (case-sensitive) name so it shouldn't matter.\n\n**Response:** Again, I hugely appreciate the effort, but there are some significant issues:\n\n1. [Environment clarification] > \"...each project parameter must have a unique (case-sensitive) name so it shouldn't matter.\"\n\nThat statement is not true, and not what I tried (perhaps unsuccessfully?) to note.  More than 1 project parameter can have the exact same case-sensitive name, provided they are shared and have different GUIDs.  (If they're not shared, then yes the names must be unique &ndash; go figure!!!)\n\nSo, for example, I could have a project parameter that is a shared parameter called \"Voltage\" with the GUID 8AB7097C-015A-4FEB-99A9-585882951695, and I could add another project parameter that is a shared parameter (from a different shared parameters file) called \"Voltage\" with the different GUID 3BDF50E5-AC43-43CA-897E-46118EDBD066 and both would show up on the list of project parameters as \"Voltage\"\n\nWorse, if they're in the same category and in the same group, in the Properties panel for an element of that category, the Revit user would actually see this:\n\n<pre>\n  Voltage\n  Voltage\n</pre>\n\nIf they're not in the same group, one could (for example) be at the top of the list and one could be at the bottom of the list, and the Revit user would probably just fill in whichever one they happened to see first. YES, we have at least 1 (very big) customer with this messed-up situation in their projects.\n\n(And which one do you pick if you're trying to build a schedule???)\n\nIf those hadn't been shared parameters, and were just regular, non-shared project parameters, then Revit would not allow me to create a second project parameter called \"Voltage\"  (again, go figure!).  But if they're shared, I can have 2 of them.  Or any number of them, if they all have different GUIDs.\n\nHowever, what I also noted was that in a single shared parameters file each parameter definition must have a unique (case-sensitive) name.  So it's easy to see how that could get confusing.  (This whole Revit \"feature\" is messed up and confusing)\n\n2. Perhaps the biggest issue with this example code is that the code for this approach presumes (and requires) that family instances have been created for at least 1 category attached to every project parameter, and by extension that families actually already exist in the project for at least 1 category attached to every project parameter.  That simply may not be the case.  Instance project parameters can be defined and associated to categories for which no instances have yet to be created.  There may not even be any families yet loaded into the project of those categories as well.  A use case for this tool may be, for example, to QA check a project file that is used as a template, or one that is early in the project lifecycle.\n\n3. The code in the example appears to assume that if it's a shared parameter, it's not a project parameter.  It further appears to assume that if it's not a shared parameter, it must be a project parameter.  Neither of these assumptions is likely to ever be correct, or would only be correct under extremely tightly controlled circumstances, which unfortunately we don't have.  Our code needs to work generically, on any project.\n\n4. And not at all insignificantly, wouldn't iterating over every parameter on every element in a project be OMG unbelievably miserably sloooow, especially for large projects?\n\nThe idea is very creative to be sure, and again the effort is very much appreciated, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be robust enough to handle any project accurately, which is what we need.\n\nSurely there's a better, more reliable/accurate way to get project parameter definition information, including whether or not a project parameter definition is shared and what its GUID is...?\n\nAgain, many thanks for your efforts!\n\n\n**Answer:** Did you run the code?\n\nYou seem confused regarding the differences between project parameters and a shared parameters. Maybe we are working from different terminolgy. \"Project Parameters\" are by definition not shared if you take Revit's 'Parameter Properties' dialog as a reference. If you are simply refering to paramaters that are present within a project document then I can see where the confusion might be, but why not just call them Parameters?\n\nIn the context of the definition above, my statement regarding project parameters (Non-Shared) requiring unique names is accurate. It is the shared parameters that can have common naming, but it is easy to differentiate them using thier GUID. At present the only way I know to get the GUID of a shared parameter without access to the correct external parameters file is to find an element that uses the parameter. This is what my example code demonstrates.\n\nYou say that you appreciate the help, but you then proceed to complain about my contribution in point form? Good luck solving your problem, I'll leave you to it then.\n\n**Response:** I really do very much appreciate your time and efforts, but I agree that we probably have different understandings of the situation.\n\n> \"Project Parameters\" are by definition not shared if you take Revit's 'Parameter Properties' dialog as a reference.\n\nHere is an image of the Revit Project Parameters 'Parameter Properties' dialog that highlights what I mean by having a project parameter that comes from a shared parameters file.  The \"Shared parameter\" radio button area is circled:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/project_parameter_guid_03.png\" alt=\"Parameter Properties\" width=\"747\">\n</center>\n\nMaybe this will help clear up the confusion?\n\nYour code does correctly demonstrate getting the GUID for a shared parameter from the project when it is in the Parameters collection of an instance element.  I did know how to get that information.\n\nBut as my earlier message with sample data mentions, I need to be able to get that information for shared instance project parameter definitions from the project when there are no instances existing in the project, or possibly even any families loaded into the project for any categories associated with the project parameter.  (That would prevent finding Type project parameter GUIDs, or the ability to create throwaway instances that can be created, queried and discarded...in other words, the data needed to \"cheat\" may not exist in the project to begin with).\n\nThat is the problem I need to solve.  I hope between the sample data and the attached images that what I need to do is easier to understand.\n\n**Answer::** I just had the thought that maybe you could temporarily bind a parameter\ndefinition to the \"Project Information\" category which would then make it\naccessible from the Document.ProjectInformation element. You can then\nanalyse it using the methods discussed earlier to determine whether it is\nshared or not and get the GUID if available. I haven't tried this yet so\nI'm not sure if it would work, worth a try I guess.\n\nWell it turns out that temporarily binding a shared parameter definition to BuiltInCategory.OST_ProjectInformation and then reading the ProjectInformation element's parameters to get at the GUID works just fine. I was unable to bind any non-shared parameters using the API which is as I was expecting due to the limited functionality available for dealing with non-shared parameters.\n\nI'm not 100% certain, but I think it is fair to say that if a parameter definition rejects binding to a category, then it must be a non-shared project parameter, while any that succeed are shared parameters (which can be confirmed by checking for IsShared just to be sure).\n\nAssuming the above rule holds true, all parameter definitions found within Document.ParameterBindings can then be categorised as shared or non-shared. In the event that several parameters are found with the same name (case-sensitive), any that are shared can be uiquely identified using the GUID and there will be at most 1 non-shared parameter which can be uniquely identified within the group based on its non-shared status.\n\nThat should get you motoring along.\n\nBy the way I'd like to thank Jeremy for his blog post and code\nfor [adding a category to a shared parameter binding](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/adding-a-category-to-a-shared-parameter-binding.htm), which I used to cobble together a quick test rig for the binding.\n\n**Response:** While it's unfortunate that we have to play games like this, the approach sounds utterly brilliant.  I had forgotten that the ProjectInformation object is effectively like a singleton &ndash; always exactly 1 element of it exists.\n\nIt's the perfect place to try to do something like this.\n\nI'll work on integrating this into my code today, but it sounds extremely promising.  I'll let you know how it goes.\n\nThank you so very much!\n\nWell, it looks like this approach should work, but only for some conditions:\n\n1. I think it will only work on instance parameters.  This is based on the the fact that Project Information is not a category choice in the Project Parameters dialog for type parameters.  Presuming that carries through in the API, now I don't know what to do about type shared parameters.\n\n2. If two or more instance parameters with identical names are already associated with the Project Information category before we start, there won't be a way to tell the existing parameters in the Project Information apart if they have the same parameter type, parameter group, etc (which they very well may).  This *might* be resolvable by trying to temporarily remove all but one of the duplicate project parameters from the Project Information category, and querying the only one left.  I'm not sure how to do that yet because I haven't played around with dissociating a category from a project parameter.\n\nSo it seems by attempting this approach (using the Project Information \"singleton\" to store Parameter instances) that accurately reporting the GUIDs for instance parameters may be possible, but it will be a LOT of work checking for and handling duplicates already assigned to that category to ensure accuracy.  At this time I still don't know what to do about getting the GUIDS for type shared project parameters.\n\n**Answer::** I was just looking into the Type Parameter issue and stumbled upon some useful but also very dangerous API behavior.\n\nThe good news is that the API will happily let you rebind a shared 'type' parameter as an instance parameter using BindingMap.ReInsert. This is great as it will then show up on the ProjectInformation element and reveal its GUID.\n\nThe problem is that any type information already stored within the project is now deleted and lost forever due to the change from instance to type binding...\n\nThis is easily cured by doing a rollback on the transaction, but be careful using this technique as it could ruin the project file if the transaction is accidentally comitted by some other part of your code. I'd suggest placing the binding and GUID investigation code within its own method encapsulated by a sub transaction and ensure that it is rolled back properly before returning. This is probably obvious advice, but better safe than sorry.\n\n**Response:** Well, after wasting about 2 days trying to hack around these deficiencies in the Revit API for a solution to this problem, we have decided to cut our losses and abandon it.  If we see duplicate project parameter names we will simply report they exist, and what they are, and walk away.\n\nThe problems really come in when you try to write code that will work under all circumstances for any project.  For just one example, (instance) project parameters (shared or not) with duplicate names may already be bound to the Project Information category before you even start.  So an approach we tried is in a temporary transaction to be rolled back, to remove all bindings for the ProjectInformation category for all project parameters, and then when it's time to try to query a Parameter guid from the ProjectInformation object, rebind the project parameters one at a time to the ProjectInformation category so there will never be more than 1 with that exact name in the ProjectInformation object's parameters collection.  This would guarantee the right Parameter object for each project parameter being tested.\n\nBut unbinding them with the API seems to only actually work for shared project parameters.  Non-shared ones simply refuse to unbind.  When you remove the ProjectInformation category from what turns out to be a non-shared project parameter and try to unbind it, it refuses to unbind but the categories collection for that parameter still shows the ProjectInformation category as NOT being in the list, even though it really is bound to the ProjectInformation object if you look at it in the GUI after committing the test transaction.  UGGGH!!!!\n\nPlus, when trying to do some of these things the DefinitionBindingMapIterator.MoveNext() method throws exceptions (exactly when is a blur right now).  So apparently there are some things you can do to a project parameter during the iteration, and some things you can't.\n\nWe've already spent far more time fighting the Revit API than management feels it is worth for whatever benefit we might gain by trying to report the GUIDs for shared project parameters.\n\nScott:  thanks again for the great ideas.  Valiant effort.  It may be possible to reliably report the GUIDs for all shared project parameters for any project under any configuration with the Revit 2014 API, but I'll only believe it when I see it.\n\nI hate to leave a problem like this unsolved, but we also have to do what we're told.\n\n**Answer:** It's unfortunate that you have to quit when you are so close. Oh well, it's been a fun little project for me, I've been wanting to learn more about parameters from the API side of things for a while now and this topic gave me the incentive to dive in.\n\nI have some ideas on how to solve the duplicate names already bound problem also, but I'll keep them to myself for now until I investigate them fully.\n\n**Answer 2:** `BindingMap.ReInsert` works well, for while `it.MoveNext` throws an exception, I used the following workaround:\n\n<pre>\npublic struct MyData\n{\n   public Definition def;\n   public ElementBinding binding;\n}\n\nwhile (it.MoveNext())\n{\n   MyData myData;\n   myData.def = it.Key;\n   myData.binding = it.Current as ElementBinding;\n   myDatas.Add(myData);\n}\n\nforeach (MyData md in myDatas)\n{\n   // do normal processing\n}\n</pre>\n\nThe final result looks like this:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/project_parameter_guid_04.jpg\" alt=\"Shared project parameter GUID\" width=\"401\">\n</center>\n\n**Response:** I had thought of an approach like that for solving the iteration exception problem, but was having other issues getting Revit to behave correctly.  Would it be possible for you to provide all the code you used in your test (a zip file would be fine)?\n\nIf it looks close to what we need it to do (including working under all conditions) we may be able to convince management to give us another couple of hours to try to perfect this for our situation.  Your code may have also resolved other issues we have run into, providing we can get things to rollback cleanly as well.\n\nRegardless, it could be a very good learning exercise to see how your code works.\n\nAt the very least, thank you very much for your idea!\n\n**Answer:** No problem, let me know if it works or there's any issue or better way\n\nThanks you guys, especially Scott, for the discussion of this interesting topic!\n\n**Answer 2:** I think the reason that `DefinitionBindingMapIterator` `MoveNext` was throwing exceptions is that you were messing with binding maps while still looping through them. It's similar to attempting to add/remove a list item while within a foreach loop operatiing on the same list.\n\nI suspect that rolling back an enclosed transaction doesn't work either as the BindingMap is probably re-built in memory by the API at each change regardless of roll-backs, invalidating the iterator's pointers.\n\nNingZhou's code solves the issue nicely by caching the definitions before looping through them. Rolling back at each loop is also a good safety measure to ensure safety of existing data. Getting the parameter from the ProjectInformation element by Definition instead of name string also solves your duplicate naming problem.\n\nI think that about covers it, nice work.\n\nHmm, just had a thought to add GUID and IsShared as extensions to the Definiton class.\n\n**Response:** Wow!  Thank you very much for providing this code.\n\nI haven't had a chance to look at this today, but am hoping to look at it again in the next couple of days.\n\nIt's greatly appreciated!\n\nThis code does appear to work *IF* none of the project parameters are already bound to the ProjectInformation category before it starts to run.\n\nWhat we eventually need to do is report which categories are associated with each project parameter (name & GUID if shared) or (name if not shared, in which case there can be only 1 with that name that is not shared).\n\nSo just reporting name-GUID combinations isn't enough, we also need to report which categories go with each exact parameter definition.  So it needs to be precise.\n\nThe attached project file presents this situation.  Each project parameter (shared or not) is bound to both the Project Information category and the Rooms category.  Again, I'm having issues getting things unbound cleanly.\n\nHowever, I have another thought.  What if I pre-save the definitions (ala the MyData approach), then using temporary, rolled back transactions, iterate over that list for each item, deleting all but the one project parameter of interest, bind it to the ProjectInformation category (if it isn't already) and then query the ProjectInformation object for the parameter by name?\n\nSo I may try that next.  Not sure what will happen to the objects in my list if I delete their parent definitions, though.  I won't be needing them during the deleted time, so maybe that will work.\n\n(Yes, there are built-in Project Information parameters like \"Organization Name\" whereby if I added my own Project Parameter with that name, it could be a duplicate in the Project Information object as well, not sure if I can filter those out by BuiltInParameter or not...I'll try to cross that bridge if I can get to it)"

This makes some sense, because you can't bind any project parameters (shared or not) that are type parameters to the Project Information category in the Revit GUI.  (So in this case the API wrongly reports the binding is successful)\n\nThe approach outlined thus far uses a known \"singleton\" (the ProjectInformation element) which works for instance parameters.  So I extended that approach (when needed) to use a known \"singleton\" (the first Wall Type element, as there must always be at least one) which works for type parameters.\n\nAttached is a text file [GetProjectParameterGUIDs.txt](zip/GetProjectParameterGUIDs.txt) with C# snippets that reasonably nicely packages all of the code needed to accurately collect information about project parameters, whether or not they are shared, and if shared what their GUIDs are.\n\nAgain, many many thanks to Scott Wilson and Ning Zhou for their ideas and code snippets to help solve this problem!"
