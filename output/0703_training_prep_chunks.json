    "chunk_text": "<h3>Preparing for a Hands-on Revit API Training</h3><p><strong>Question:</strong> I have registered for a hands-on Revit API Training, but I have little experience in programming, and almost none in .NET or C#.\nHow can I prepare for it to make best use of this opportunity?\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is actually all described in the discussion on\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html\">\ngetting started with the Revit 2012 API</a>.\n\nStill, let's highlight some of the points and put them in proper order for you.\n\n<p>The first of the following items is of interest for anyone just getting started with programming, .NET, or C#.\nAll the rest are for those with some prior .NET programming experience:\n\n<ol>\n<li>Work through some .NET programming tutorial. \nThere are lots on free online .NET tutorials available.\nI mentioned a few in the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html#4\">\ngetting started overview</a>.\n\nSome more advanced and interesting hints are listed in the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/c-and-net-little-wonders.html\">\nC# and .NET little wonders</a>.\n\nEven spending just a day working through such a tutorial will make an enormous difference.\n\n\n<li>Install the Revit SDK, available from the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>, \n\nand \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html#1\">\nset up the environment</a>.\n\n<li>Read the first chapter of the Developer Guide \"Revit 2012 API Developer Guide.pdf\", \n\n<a href=\"http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2012/Help/API_Dev_Guide/0001-Introduc1/0002-Welcome_2\">\nWelcome to the Revit Platform API</a>, also available online.\n\n\n<li>Work through the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/my-first-revit-plug-in.html\">\nMy First Revit Plugin</a> tutorial, \n\nalso available for\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/my-first-revit-plug-in-in-vb.html\">\nVB</a>,\n\nboth again from the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit\">Revit Developer Center</a>.\n\nThe developer center also provides further introductory training videos, the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/revit-2011-devtv.html\">\nDevTV recordings</a>.\n\nEquivalently, work through the hands-on tutorials in the developer guide Chapter 2,\n\n<a href=\"http://wikihelp.autodesk.com/Revit/enu/2012/Help/API_Dev_Guide/0001-Introduc1/0012-Getting_12\">\nGetting Started</a>.\n\n\n<li>Install the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/revitlookup-update.html\">\nRevitLookup</a> add-in,\n\nincluded in the Revit SDK.\n\nThis really is <i>the</i> most important development tool for interactively exploring the internals of the Revit database, and of great interest for advanced end users as well, actually.\n\n<li> Install the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/loading-sdk-sam.html\">\nRvtSamples</a> external \n\napplication add-in, which is also provided as part of the Revit SDK.\n\nIt provides an interface to load and run all of the hundred-plus other SDK samples, instead of installing them individually, which makes the exploration and debugging of their functionality <i>much</i> more accessible.\nHere are some pointers to\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/revit-api-training-preparation.html\">\nmore information on RvtSamples</a>.\n\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></ol>\n<p>All of these steps are described in more detail in numerous other places. \nMany of them are pointed to from the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/10/getting-started-with-the-revit-2012-api.html\">\ngetting started guide</a>.\n\n<p>The blog also defines a dedicated category providing a collection of all the \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/getting_started\">\ngetting started material</a>.\n\n<p>Some additional notes on these issues are provided by a previous take on this very issue of \n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/revit-api-training-preparation.html\">\npreparing for a hands-on training</a>.\n\nYou might also be interested in this overview of the\n\n<a href=\"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/revit-api-training-preparation.html\">\ntraining material</a> that \n\nwe use in our own classes.\n\n<p>This should cover everything of importance up-front pretty thoroughly  :-)\n\n<p>Good luck getting started, don't give up, and above all <b>have fun!</b>\n<a name=\"elephant\"></a>\n<h4>Dances With
