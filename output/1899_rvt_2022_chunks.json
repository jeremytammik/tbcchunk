Our best understanding of how these particles and three of the forces are related to each other is encapsulated in the Standard Model of particle physics. Developed in the early 1970s, it has successfully explained almost all experimental results and precisely predicted a wide variety of phenomena. Over time and through many experiments, the Standard Model has become established as a well-tested physics theory.\n  \n  [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model)\n\ntwitter:\n\nRevit 2022 has been released!

Allowed editing of Shaft openings (opening between two Levels) by SketchEditScope.\n    - New API Level.GetNearestLevelId() methods to get closest Level at specified elevation.\n    - Implement new Floor.Create() methods. Marked floor creation methods in Document.Create as obsoleted. Implemented Floor.GetDefaultFloorType() and Level.GetNearestLevelId() API methods.\n- Parameters\n    - Renamed the following values in the Autodesk.Revit.DB.BuiltInParameterGroup enumeration:   PG_TERMINTATION to PG_TERMINATION, PG_AELECTRICAL to PG_ELECTRICAL, and PG_ELECTRICAL to PG_ELECTRICAL_ENGINEERING. PG_ELECTRICAL now identifies the parameter group \"Electrical\", so applications which do not adjust will find their parameters moved from \"Electrical Engineering\" to \"Electrical\".\n    - Deprecated the ParameterType enumeration. Added static methods to the Parameter class to retrieve all parameter, group, and spec identifiers.\n    - LabelUtils.GetLabelForSpec(ForgeTypeId) has been changed to support non-measurable specs. Definition.GetSpecTypeId() has been deprecated in favor of Definition.GetDataType().\n    - Added three static methods for accessing ForgeTypeId identifiers for built-in categories in the Revit API class Category: static ForgeTypeId GetBuiltInCategoryTypeId(BuiltInCategory), static BuiltInCategory GetBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId), and static bool IsBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId).\n    - In class Category, added three static methods for accessing ForgeTypeId identifiers for built-in categories:\n        - static ForgeTypeId GetBuiltInCategoryTypeId(BuiltInCategory)\n        - static BuiltInCategory GetBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId)\n        - static bool IsBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId)\n    - Deprecated UnitGroup enumeration. Use ForgeTypeId instead. References to specific values of the UnitGroup enumeration may be replaced with references to the properties of new class DisciplineTypeId. Deprecated method UnitUtils.GetUnitGroup(ForgeTypeId). Use new method UnitUtils.GetDiscipline(ForgeTypeId) instead. Added new method LabelUtils.GetLabelForDiscipline(ForgeTypeId). Added new method UnitUtils.GetAllDisciplines().\n    - Deprecated UnitGroup enumeration. Use ForgeTypeId instead. References to specific values of the UnitGroup enumeration may be replaced with references to the properties of new class DisciplineTypeId.\n    - Deprecated method UnitUtils.GetUnitGroup(ForgeTypeId). Use new method UnitUtils.GetDiscipline(ForgeTypeId) instead.\n    - Added new method LabelUtils.GetLabelForDiscipline(ForgeTypeId).\n    - Added new method UnitUtils.GetAllDisciplines().\n    - Deprecated Revit API functions based on the ParameterType enumeration in favor of new functions based on the ForgeTypeId class.\n    - Improved Revit API functionality related to Family Type shared parameters.\n    - Added ForgeTypeId constants to nested classes Boolean, Int, Reference, and String within the SpecTypeId class identifying non-floating-point parameter data types.\n- Revit Cloud Model (workshared)\n    - Improved the API WorksharingUtils.GetUserWorksetInfo() efficiency in Revit cloud models.\n    - Improved clarity of exceptions potentially raised when using the cloud model link API.\n    - Provided exceptions for cloud model initiate API.\n    - Updated the PostableCommand enum API to reflect the latest status of Revit commands.\n    - Provided API to initiate workshared cloud models.\n    - Removed 2 obsolete API: ModelPathUtils.ConvertCloudGUIDsToCloudPath(Guid projectId, Guid modelId) and Document.SaveAsCloudModel(String folderId, String modelName).\n    - Extended existing API Document.SaveAsCloudModel() to initiate workshared cloud models.\n    - Provided Revit API for linking cloud models."
