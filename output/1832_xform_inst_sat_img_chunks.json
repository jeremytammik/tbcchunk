Thanks!\n\n**Answer:** The family instance reuses the geometry defined for the family symbol by applying a transform to it.\n\nThe symbol geometry is generally close to the origin.\n\nEvery instance needs a different transformation, depending on where the instance is placed in the model.\n\nYou need to apply the family instance transformation to the geometry to transform it from the family symbol definition coordinates to the project model coordinates where the instance has been placed:\n\n- [GetTransform](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/50aa275d-031e-ce19-9cfd-18a7a341ed19.htm)\n- [GetTotalTransform](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/8c8aff2b-5ff9-e43a-3b5c-308cd0174f1f.htm)\n\nThe roof element is different, since it is modelled in place using a sketch.\n\n**Response:** Awesome! This worked! Thank you much Jeremy!\n\nFor anyone interested, here is how I edited the code based on Jeremy's suggestion:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Reference</span>&nbsp;faceRef&nbsp;=&nbsp;sel.PickObject(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">ObjectType</span>.Face&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">GeometryObject</span>&nbsp;geoObj&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.GetElement(&nbsp;faceRef&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.GetGeometryObjectFromReference(&nbsp;faceRef&nbsp;);\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Instance</span>&nbsp;moduleInstance&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.GetElement(&nbsp;faceRef&nbsp;)&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Instance</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Transform</span>&nbsp;moduleTransform&nbsp;=&nbsp;moduleInstance.GetTotalTransform();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">PlanarFace</span>&nbsp;moduleFace&nbsp;=&nbsp;geoObj&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">PlanarFace</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">IList</span>&lt;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">CurveLoop</span>&gt;&nbsp;faceEdges&nbsp;=&nbsp;moduleFace.GetEdgesAsCurveLoops();\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">foreach</span>(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">CurveLoop</span>&nbsp;loop&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">in</span>&nbsp;faceEdges&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop.Transform(&nbsp;moduleTransform&nbsp;);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n \n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">FilledRegion</span>&nbsp;fillRegion&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">FilledRegion</span>.Create(&nbsp;doc,&nbsp;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stringFillType.Id,&nbsp;currentView.Id,&nbsp;faceEdges&nbsp;);\n</pre>\n\nMany thanks to Chris for raising the issue and confirming the solution!"

One of these things is the satellite image I'm seeking to import here.\n\nEssentially, my question is exactly the same\nas [Google maps image in 3D view](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-architecture-forum/google-maps-image-in-3d-view/m-p/8100681),\nbut instead doing that programmatically/automatically through an add-in.\nIn that thread, a suggestion is made to create a decal with the desired image, but this does not seem to be supported through the API.\n\nAnother approach I found is\nto [use `PostCommand`](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/10/programmatic-custom-add-in-external-command-launch.html) to\ncreate and place decals, but these commands are apparently\nonly [executed after exiting the API context](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2014/ENU/Revit/files/GUID-1C7289DE-8D10-47B5-B6DB-EA1310851C8F-htm.html) and\nonly one at a time.\nAs my add-in aims to perform a whole bunch of functionalities in one go, this seems ill-suited for my use case.\nIt seems to be possible to chain a bunch of PostCommands, but this is a little 'hacky' and not recommended, especially for commercial use.\n\nAm I overlooking some existing functionality?\nIs my use case just not supported in current Revit?\nI'm new to programming for Revit, so it's very possible I've missed something.\n\nI'm running / programming for Revit 2019 on Windows 10.\n\n**Answer:** What about creating a new material, setting its texture path, then making a `TopoSurface` and assigning the material to it, cf. [modifying material visual appearance](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/11/modifying-material-visual-appearance.html)?\n\nI don't know how to adjust the `UV` mapping for the `TopoSurface`, but if it worked, you would see your satellite image in 3D.\n\n**Response:** Thanks to all for the replies!\nIt took some time to try out the proposed solution (accessing AppearanceElements is convoluted!), so that's why it took me this long to reply.\n\nIn the end, though I had to work around some weird quirks with the API, adding the image as a texture to a topography through a material works great.\n\nThanks again for the suggestion, I couldn't have made it work without it.\n\nMany thanks to Harm for raising this and to Revitalizer for the good suggestion."
