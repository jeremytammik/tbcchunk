    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"4\"></a>Communication between AutoCAD and Revit\n\nI am developing an application that will use both AutoCAD and Revit.\n\nI develop a design in AutoCAD and then open that design data in Revit.\n\nWhat is the best method to achieve this?\n\nI see a couple of feasible options:\n\n1. Direct link between AutoCAD and Revit in a class inheriting from `IExternalCommand` and passing data directly through method calls.\n2. Using an external third executable program to act as an intermediary.\n3. Using a file as an intermediary.\n4. Implementing a TCP connection between programs.\n\nAre there any other options?\n\n**Answer:** I would suggest trying number 1 first.\n\nThere are two important aspects to consider here.\n\nFirst, AutoCAD makes it really easy for you, since it provides a COM interface that can be driven through .NET and can be used to access the AutoCAD.NET API from outside AutoCAD.\n\nFor instance, through it, you can launch AutoCAD, open, create, read, write and otherwise manipulate a drawing, and close down AutoCAD again.\n\nSecondly, you cannot do the same for Revit.\n\nRevit makes it a little bit harder for you to drive it from outside.\n\nThe Revit API is entirely based on events.\n\nYou cannot use the Revit API except in a valid Revit API context, and a valid Revit API context is provided by Revit API events and nothing else.\n\nFor more details on this, please refer to The Building Coder topic group\non [Idling and external events for modeless access and driving Revit from outside](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28).\n\nNow for the good part: the combination of these two is easily possible.\n\nYou can implement a Revit add-in that also makes use of the AutoCAD.NET API and thus achieve the direct link that you suggest in item 1."
