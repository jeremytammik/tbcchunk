    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"3\"></a> Revit Element Ids in Forge via Navisworks and IFC\n\nThis question prompted me to create a new topic group\non [element identification using `ElementId` and `UniqueId` RVT, IFC, NW and Forge](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.56):\n\n**Question:** I created a Navisworks file from a Revit file and submitted it to Forge.\nThe returning translated JSON looks like this:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/forge_model_derivative-nw-rvt.png\" alt=\"RVT to NW element id in Forge\" width=\"600\"> <!-- 809 -->\n</center>\n\nWhat is this `externalId` and where does it come from?\n\nThe `Id` property maps to the Revit element id.\n\nCan you please confirm?\n\nWhere is the source Revit element unique id?\n\nIs it lost during this process?\n\n**Answer:** The `externalId` is the path through the model selection tree to that item.\nAs far as I know, Revit doesn't have per-element GUIDs, but instead each element has a unique id.\nThis is what you have highlighted at the bottom of the image.\n\nThis is how we expect NWD files to look like when converted to SVF.\n\nYou cannot expect the data to look exactly the same as the RVT file.\n\n**Response:** This is what the source Revit file looks like in JSON:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/forge_model_derivative-rvt.png\" alt=\"RVT element ids in Forge\" width=\"715\">\n</center>\n\nIn this case, the `externalId` is the `Element.UniqueID` GUID.\n\nThe `Name` property contains the `Element.Id`.\n\n\n**Answer:** Yes, I know they are different, which you would expect, really, as you are converting different types of files.\n\nRevit creates a unique id by appending together\nthe [document-level EpisodeId GUID with the Element ID in hex](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/uniqueid-dwf-and-ifc-guid.html#2):\n\n<pre>\n  0088CA1F hex = 8964639 decimal\n</pre>\n\n**Response:** In this case, in order to find the Revit element in the converted Navisworks file, we actually need to parse the name and get the Id out of it? I was expecting a property to hold this value.\n\nI find strange that in the translated source Revit file we don't actually have an \"Id\" property.\n\nI thought that the `\"`externalId` in the translated source RVT file, was the actual id to look for in the translated NWD file.\n\nI need to consistently identify elements in NWD and IFC files generated out of a source RVT file.\n\nLooking at the Forge model derivative JSON files, it seems we can have\n\n- Take the `Id` out of the `Name` for the RVT\n- The `Element.Id` for the NWD\n- The `IfcTag` for the IFC\n\nHere is an image showing all three:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/forge_model_derivative-nwd-rvt-ifc.png\" alt=\"Element ids in Forge RVT, NW and IFC files\" width=\"1802\">\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** Yes.\n\nThe Revit extractor puts the Element ID in the object name, so you can get it from there.\n\nThe NW extractor has the Element ID as a specific property (in the Element category).\n\nThe IFC file has the Element ID in the IfcTag attribute.\n\nIn NW, we try to read as much property data as we can. From there, if the property is visible in NW, it is exported on into the SVF file. The NW to SVF extractor implements special handling for different formats. Once the file has been converted to NWC/NWD, we don't really know what source file type it was originally. Furthermore, because not all file formats have unique ids for elements, NW doesn't have a concept of unique elements ids either; hence, it can only output the path through the tree for the `externalId` property."
