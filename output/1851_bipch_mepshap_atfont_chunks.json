    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"2\"></a> Get MEP Duct Shape Update\n\nWe have looked at how to determine the MEP duct shape repeatedly in the past, e.g., in the articles on:\n\n- [Distinguishing MEP element shape](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/distinguishing-mep-element-shape.html)\n- [Improved MEP Element Shape](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/05/improved-mep-element-shape-and-mount-ararat.html)\n- [IFC Import Levels and MEP Element Shapes](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/02/ifc-import-levels-and-mep-element-shapes.html)\n\nThe question came up again in the following discussion, and the solution is now &ndash; and has been for some time now &ndash; at hand:\n\n**Question:** How can I figure out the duct shape (oval, rectangular or round) from `DuctType` independently of its `FamilyName`? The FamilyName is a localized string, so cannot get the shape info out from it.\n\n**Answer:** You can get the shape based on the connectors. \n\n**Response:** Does `DuctType` have connector?\n\n**Answer:** I'm not sure..... are you using FabricationParts or generics? Check to see if your element has a connector manager, then check the shape property on your connectors.\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;fabPart&nbsp;=&nbsp;myElement&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">FabricationPart</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">foreach</span>(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">Connector</span>&nbsp;conn\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">in</span>&nbsp;fabPart.ConnectorManager.Connectors&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">var</span>&nbsp;shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;conn.Shape;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n</pre>\n\n**Response:** I am using generic ducts, not `FabricationParts`.\n\nI looked at The Building Coder posts listed above, but they don't work.\n\n**Answer:** Perhaps you could take some of the code found in here?\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">DuctType</span>&nbsp;dt&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.GetElement(&nbsp;tid&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">as</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">DuctType</span>;\n \n<span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span>(&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">null</span>&nbsp;!=&nbsp;dt&nbsp;)\n{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span>(&nbsp;HasInvalidElementIdValue(&nbsp;e,&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInParameter</span>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_OVALROUND_PARAM&nbsp;)&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;rectangular&quot;</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">else</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span>(&nbsp;HasInvalidElementIdValue(&nbsp;e,&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInParameter</span>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_RECTOVAL_PARAM&nbsp;)&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;round&quot;</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">else</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span>(&nbsp;HasInvalidElementIdValue(&nbsp;e,&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2b91af;\">BuiltInParameter</span>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.RBS_CURVETYPE_MULTISHAPE_TRANSITION_PARAM&nbsp;)&nbsp;)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#a31515;\">&quot;oval&quot;</span>;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n}\n</pre>\n\n**Response:** This is the same code I found in the link above; it fails when opening a new project not using the mechanical template.\n\n**Answer:** You should be able to call `getProfileType` that is defined in the base class of the type to get the shape. If that doesn't work, you can use first code snippet above; if you replace the `FabricationPart` with `Duct` or `FamilyInstance` (for fittings), you can get the profile shape from the connectors.\nThe profile type is an enum, so there should be no string related issues.\n\n**Response:** The old version of the Revit API that I am using cannot find `getProfileType` in the `DuctType` base class. The example code above only works when opening a new project using the mechanical template.\n\n**Answer:** It should be defined in the `MEPCurveType` class; it was exposed to the API in 2019.\n\n**Response:** Thanks, we are switching to 2019 soon, I will use it after that, finding a workaround for now.\nOn Revit 2018, I found that if I create a new project file using the Architectural Template, its three `DuctType` elements only have `Default` on each. In this case, the sample code above does not work. Which API function can create duct types just as when I create a new project using the Mechanical Template? \n\n**Answer:** I don't think using the duct type will work for what you are trying to do unless you are using 2019 or later. If you access the duct or duct fitting (family instance) and get the connectors from the connector manager from the element you should be able to get the shape. That shape is the same for both.\n\n**Response:** Our plugin is trying to recreate duct type from the data stored externally before drawing a duct instance. For example, if the plugin stores an oval duct type externally called `newDuctType1`, in order to insert this duct instance into the model, it needs to create this duct type in Oval Duct first. The plugin can hard code the \"Oval\" string to find FamilyName \"Oval Duct\" in the English version of Revit, but it will not work in other languages. This is why I am looking for a solution or workaround in 2018 to determine the shape from duct type.\n\nLater: I have not found any solution for 2018. We decide to use the sample routine (see above) you created but it works only if all three duct types (oval, rectangular and round) have real duct type in them. The workaround on 2018:\n\nIf none of the three parameters in the sample routine return a valid element id, it means the drawing does not have any real duct types except the ones called “Default”; then it displays a warning to the user, asks her to transfer duct types from some other model and delete the ones called “Default”.\n\n**Answer:** I am sure the workaround can be improved, and that a reliable algorithm to distinguish MEP element shapes can be devised. For instance, you could look at the number, geometrical location and direction of the connectors. That will provide a lot of information. You can look at the geometry.\n\nLater: Did you ever resolve this?\n\n**Response:** For Revit 2019 and newer, there is a new `DuctType` property for this, `DuctType.Shape`.\n\nFor Revit 2018 and older, we get the value from the RoutingPreferenceRuleGroupType enumeration values\nTransitionsRectangularToRound, TransitionsRectangularToOval and TransitionsOvalToRound, then check whether the returned list has count 0."

on the system and may not be in use by an element in Revit?\n\nThis is indeed Revit API specific.\nI can get the value of the fonts in use by text types, dimension types, etc., by reading the `TEXT_FONT` parameter.\nI can also get the fonts on the system by using\nthe [`InstalledFontCollection` class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.text.installedfontcollection?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1).\nIt requires a reference to `System.Drawing`.\nBut neither of these can return the `@Name` fonts that appear in the UI for picking a font.\nSo, the question is, how can I get the list of fonts that Revit lists for my application?\n\nCode to get system fonts:\n\n<pre

the '@ness'.\n\n**Response:** The method used in the link you sent to AEC DevBlog helped.\nIt gives more fonts than are shown by Revit but I think I can work with it.\n\nMany thanks to Richard for the
