Let’s imagine that you’d like to write properties into one file.\n[A] right and wrong – right because while you can do anything in the viewer, you cannot save in the Forge bubble. However, you can decide to save into an external database and since unique IDs are preserved, you can reload the saved data next time. We got samples on GitHub doing that, e.g.,\nhttps://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/\nhttps://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/viewer?id=57efaead77c8eb0a560ef465\nhttps://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-rcdb.nodejs\n\nI am evaluating the use of the BIM 360 products and Forge.\nI would like to connect all my AEC data regarding construction, cost estimation, etc., through an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).\n[Q1] How can Forge connect with an ESB? Any further examples besides Forge-RCDB?\n[A1] Rc-db sample is mainly a front-end website, so not applicable to an ESB principle unless you implement a socket.io protocol. However, the sample also has a server, which could be integrated with an ESB. You would need to write the adapter for it.\n[Q2] How Forge could connect with Event Driven Architecture (EDA)?\n[A2] Like all our samples, using an node.js npm module for the server, or socket.io for the client side.\n[Q3] Other examples of integration Forge and graphics, such as charts, pie-charts, etc.?\n[A3] Visual-report sample, and better still\nhttps://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/configurator?id=583ec7efebfb320e3cef26a5\nhttps://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/configurator?id=57f3739777c879f48ad54a44\nCheck this page for a basic routing table (WIP)\nhttps://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/configurator\n[Q4] Assuming we have a model from designers, and the programmers create an app like this - https://calm-inlet-4387.herokuapp.com/ and set references between 3d -model, 2d – drawing and graphics (Chart, Pie-chart). What happens when the model is slightly modified? – geometry or properties - will the programmers need to manually recreate references between the objects for the app to work correctly? Or can they create it using rules from the model to keep track and maintain references between objects?\n[A4] You can implement it any way you want. If you want to automate things and apply rules, you can. Forge is very basic and very flexible.\nProgrammers can also add custom data to the model, for example in Inventor using iProperties, which will also be available in Forge and can be used by custom logic to automate mappings between components, graphics and so on ... DbIds in viewer can change if original model is modified, however, for Revit projects, 2D/3D views dbIds will stay in sync: selecting a component in 2D can be automatically mapped to the corresponding element in the 3D view and vice-versa.\n\nForgify prepare a complex RVT model for Forge translation http://bit.ly/forgify #RevitAPI @AutodeskRevit #aec #bim #dynamobim @AutodeskForge\n\nI am officially taking time off right now, but still jumping in here and there anyway, e.g. in an urgent case to reduce the RVT model file size before passing it into the Forge translator\n&ndash; RvtForgify\n&ndash; Forge read-write\n&ndash; Forge in an Enterprise Service Bus...\n\n-->"
