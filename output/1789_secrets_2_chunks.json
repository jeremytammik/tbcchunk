    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"5\"></a> Making Blocks in Revit DWG Export\n\nA recent discussion on how to ensure that family instances in Revit are exported to DWG blocks, or, alternatively, how to reassemble together block from them after the export:\n\n**Question:** I have a Revit plugin that exports to DWG and an AutoCAD plugin that imports the newly created DWG.\nFor Revit exports, some Revit family instances are exported as 1-1 Fam Instance->Blocks, while other Revit family instances with similar geo complexity are exported as a collection of individual lines, arcs, squares, etc. &ndash; not a block.\nIâ€™m trying to find a way to tell Revit to export family instances as blocks always but unsure if this is possible.\nAlso unsure if I can add a property to a Revit fam instance inside Revit in a way that when it exports to the DWG as multiple primitives, I could cleverly reassemble the primitives as a block.\nCould anyone help me identify if either API workflow is possible?\n\n**Answer:** I assume that if there options, they are not just exposed to the API, but also in the UI.\n\n**Response:** I'm attempting everything as a user first.\nThe settings for export don't have a block setting (only solids vs. mesh setting, have used both).\nI'm not able to add properties that carry over to let me identify objects in AutoCAD.\nFor example, element id's don't come in as attributes, so I don't have any logic that can sweep up primitives and assemble as a block.\nAlso, I have fam instances like electrical fixtures that come in as several arcs, lines and annotation layered vs. single block with geo layer, so I'm not able to identify a programmatic way to assemble the anno, primitive, elec fixtures and turn them into a single block as geo layer since there are no mapping id's.\nI've used Revit Snoop and Acad MgdDbg to look under the hood for any matching id's between outgoing element and incoming objects, but they don't exist.\nI found id's in acad object `XData` but they are not related to element id's either.\nHas anyone created an alternative export tool that gives more control to modify objects programmatically after import?\nMaybe I just export all geometry myself in Revit with unique id's and metadata in json/xml and construct things on the import side?\nIs that dumb?\n\n<!---\nEssentially trying to fill requirements in the attached but my description above should cover it.\nLooking to programmatically allow customers to export parameters, export geometry consistently, but moreso be able to discover on the autocad side whether any mapped unique id can be used to say \"hey you were this in revit, let me change you after import based on additional metadata I stored somewhere\".\n\nPowerPoint Presentation Bldgs_RVTtoDWG_trimmed.pptx\n\n/a/doc/revit/tbc/doc/Bldgs_RVTtoDWG_trimmed.pptx\n--->\n\n**Answer:** The DWG export algorithm uses the geometry that the instance object is producing for drawing on screen and based on the types of primitives will export it as a block or not.\nMost families produce a `GInstance` nodes, which behaves like a block in AutoCAD.\nIt is a collection of geometric primitives (lines, arc etc.) and a `Transformation` that defines the coordinates.\nThis type of node is exported as a block.\nAs you observed, there are families that produce only geometric primitives and the exporter doesn't consider them as a block.\nUnfortunately, I don't have any advice to you. It seems that needs to be implemented on Revit side.\nThe families that are exported as lines and arcs should construct their representation as a `GInstance`.\nI'm not sure this is doable.\n\nIâ€™m also thinking about the solutions with ids.\nI remember that each AutoCAD entity's xdata contains the `ElementId` from the Revit element.\nYou can see this using the `xdlist` command in AutoCAD.\nFor families exported as blocks, you should run this command on the block reference, not on the entities that compose the block &ndash; these donâ€™t have xdata.\nCan you give me an example where this rule doesnâ€™t apply? I remember that there were some issues for elements that comes from linked files (they have ids but from a different document).\nWhy do you group AutoCAD entities same as the Revit entities? What are you trying to achieve?\n\n<!--- \n**Response:**\n\nWe don't have a list of families, we're just starting with one to keep a controlled environment.  I've simplified an example with the attached ZIP.  It includes a single RVT to export a single sheet, outputted DWG of that single sheet and two image files for commentary.  You can dismiss any links that cannot be found.  The category I believe is electrical fixtures.  This is 2019 but its probably the same behavior in 2020.  The images will state the problem probably best.  Maybe nested families behave differently?  What could we do to either programmatically change it on AutoCAD or prep the RVT pre-export?\n\nWe are creating a \"super exporter\" where we want to leverage the export to dwg feature via API but also we want to export (separately) a lot of param data and change layers outside the settings feature.  If you look at my ZIP, there is one specific example where a family instance comes over as individual primitives on ANNO layer, whereas I would expect one block on Geo layer. Because its broken up into many primitives I can't retrace it back to the original fam instance nor know how to group them into a new block since the xdata for at least one of the prims doesn't have original fam instance Revit id. Could you look at the attached?  The two images provided paint the problem best.\n\nAngel Velez:squirrel:  17 days ago\nHave you looked at IFC?  Is DWG the base point you want for geometry + data?\n\nTim Burnham  17 days ago\nStantec wants a fully automated DWG deliverable to their customers where the model stems from Revit.  They do a lot of cleanup work that I'm automating.  IFC is not preferred in this case and these guys are pretty neck deep for years into the export feature so the issues are very isolated.\n\nTim Burnham  17 days ago\nThe attached zip above is really asking how I can either prep the fam instance on Revit's side so that it exports as a block, or is there something i can do on the autocad side to discover and group all these primitives into a block.  Hoping the former has a workflow I can do.\n\n**Answer:** \n--->\n\nI looked at your sample files and I understood the issue.\n\nItâ€™s about nested families in certain conditions &ndash; the nested Family is 'shared' and the nested family is an annotation family while the main one isn't.\n\nIn your example the symbol (shared family) has a mark that is different from the mark of family instance containing it.\nIt looks like the intent is to schedule the two components differently, even though in Revit they are placed using the same family.\nIf this is the case, you can add a logic to group all the primitives from the shared family into its own block.\nYou can look at each entityâ€™s xData where you will find ID of element that produced that entity.\nI donâ€™t know of a way to get the ID of the family instance and tie it to all the shared families contained, in case you want a block containing all the entities from the family and shared families.\n\n**Response:** This is great, thank you!\n\nOne other easy'ish question: What do the other xdata index values indicate?\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/rvt_dwg_export_xdata.png\" alt=\"Revit DWG export xdata\" width=\"600\">\n</center>\n\n**Answer:** Here are the codes that we use, cf.\nthe [DWG and DXF export `Xdata` specification](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/08/dwg-and-dxf-export-xdata-specification.html):\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n  // XData Identifiers\n  #define XDATA_ELEMENT_ID                     1\n  #define XDATA_CATEGORY_ID                    2\n  #define XDATA_SUB_CATEGORY_ID                3\n  #define XDATA_MATERIAL_ID                    4\n  #define XDATA_TYPE_ID                        5\n  #define XDATA_IS_MATERIAL_OVERRIDDEN_BY_FACE 6\n  // Room boundary and area XDATA\n  #define XDATA_ROOM_NAME_ID                 101\n  #define XDATA_ROOM_NUMBER_ID               102\n  #define XDATA_ROOM_OCCUPANCY_ID            103\n  #define XDATA_ROOM_DEPARTMENT_ID           104\n  #define XDATA_ROOM_COMMENTS_ID             105\n</pre>"
