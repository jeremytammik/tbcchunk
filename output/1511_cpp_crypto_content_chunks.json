We have hundreds of products in CAD and various other 3D formats.  We've been told we would need to remake every one of our products in Revit from scratch.  However, I've been able to import our CAD files and work with them in the software but I was told that because they weren't made natively in Revit that they're essentially useless.  Is this true and if so, what sort of training would be required to move forward?  Can't we just add the dimension information to our previously made items within Revit?  We've been quoted thousands just to make a portion of our library into Revit families and we've already spent thousands leasing the software thus far with no success.\n\n**Answer:** Sorry to hear that this issue is troubling you.\n \nI always recommend generating all such libraries completely parametrically from scratch.\n \nThat would have meant, way back then before you created any CAD content at all, defining a programmatic way to generate that CAD content from a database of parametric definitions and lists of dimensions of all your library parts.\n \nI have been recommending that approach (mostly in vain) for about four decades now.\n \nThe people who listened to it back then are very happy now that they did.\n \nThey are all too few.\n \nMost people go and implement CAD content by hand, over and over again, every time the system changes.\n \nWell, so be it then.\n \nIf the content is generated programmatically from a database of rules and dimensions, you can simply implement a new content generator for each system that you wish to populate. The database content driving it remains unchanged.\n \nBack to your issue at hand:\n \nIf you have tested using families based on the imported CAD geometry in Revit without problems, then that is obviously a feasible option.\n \nHowever, you really need to ensure and verify that this works reliably under all circumstances.\n \nFor instance, if you are a chair manufacturer, try using your CAD-import-based family in a hospital or airport with thousands or tens of thousands of instances.\n \nThat may cause problems.\n \nFurthermore, it might not be easy to equip the CAD-import-based parts with all the dimensions that drive their different sizes, aka family types aka symbols.\n \nHere is a recommendation\nto [think twice before importing CAD into RFA](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/09/avoid-cad-import-in-rfa-aag16-and-endtrip.html#2).\n \nGood luck finding an efficient and viable solution for your task!\n \n**Response:** Thank you so much for your reply,\n\nYour post along with the provided links will help me rationalise to the company why we need to create the content natively.\n\nI'm essentially a one-man band over here and re-making all of the thousands of items from scratch, especially when coding\nis not my forte, is not a feasible option.  \n\nI greatly appreciate your reply!"
