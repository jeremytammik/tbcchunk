    "chunk_text": "#### <a name=\"3\"></a>Rendering Assets\n\nBack to the pure Revit API, I have been asked repeatedly about the possibilities to access and manipulate textures and other rendering assets.\n\nHere is the latest incarnation of such a question:\n\n**Question:** The Revit API enables creating structural and thermal assets and setting their properties with the help of the `StructuralAsset` and `ThermalAsset` classes.\n\nHowever, I don't see any similar classes for appearance assets.\n\nThe only related class I can find is the `AppearanceAssetElement`, and this class seems to work completely differently.\n\nCan I create a new `AppereanceAsset` or duplicate an existing one and edit its properties?\n\nOr is there another way to edit the appearance asset of a material?\n\nFurthermore, it appears that the Render Appearance is stored in an `.adsklib` file, and this is a shared format between different Autodesk products.\n\nIs it not possible to edit the Revit render appearance asset in Revit itself, would it be possible to do so in some other program and then import it into Revit?\n\n**Answer:** Yes, you can edit and create AppearanceAssetElement objects.\n\nLook at The Building Coder discussion of [What's New in the Revit 2014 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2014-api.html):\n\n<span style=\"color:green\">"

You might want to take a look at Aaron Lu's explanation and sample code showing [how to access a material's asset properties](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2015/03/revitapi-how-to-get-asset-properties-of-material-i-want.html).\n\nB. Unfortunately, as said, we do not have full access to all asset properties, e.g., here is a request that we cannot currently satisfy:\n\n[Q] My family has a parameter that defines a colour for this component (by default, the parameter is assigned a material with a default colour). I want to create a new material with a specific colour. This works fine. The problem comes when I switch to realistic. The component takes the colour from an Appearance Asset. How can I create and assign a new Asset for a Material? Probably, the fix will come by checking the option 'Use Render Appearance' from the Shading properties and assigning the colour to the created Asset. Does the Revit API provide support for this?\n\n[A] Unfortunately the API currently does not provide full access to all assets.\n\nC. You might also want to check out The Building Coder topic group on [Material Management and Libraries](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.5).\n\nD. If your workflow requires adding a material that is not currently available, one approach might be to copy and paste it from some other Revit file, or loading an asset from some other product like Inventor via an ADSK package:\n\n- [Loading an Inventor ADSK component](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/12/loading-an-inventor-adsk-component.html)\n- [ADSK file import](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/08/adsk-file-import-and-phase-of-room.html)\n\nE. Furthermore, you might want to check the Revit API discussion forum thread on [Revit API materials and textures](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/revit-api-materials-and-textures/m-p/6319370).\n\nThe latest comment there by Scott Wilson is especially interesting:\n\n> I have a finite set of actual textures the will be used which doesn't change very often (Basically it's just the set of standard steel roofing colours but the specified sheet thickness and coating type will change for each situation.) I also have control over the project templates that are used so I created a set of template materials with structured naming that identify the texture applied. When I need a new textured material I find the appropriate template material, duplicate it and set the other properties as needed. I have built a little framework around this that allows the user to add new template materials also if they follow the same structured naming scheme. I know this won't work for many, but I just thought I'd share my limited workaround for those it might help.\n\nFinally, let me point out an existing wish list item to enhance this access, CF-234 [API wish: apply photo texturing -- 08963731]."
