    "chunk_text": "<h4>DevCamp</h4><p>Registration for the AEC DevCamp on June 7-9, 2010, in Boston, MA has opened.\nThis is the software developer conference for anyone considering or actively developing applications and integrations with Autodesk architecture, engineering, and construction technologies.\nBesides all versions of Revit, this also includes AutoCAD Architecture, Navisworks, and the infrastructure technologies Civil 3D, Map 3D and MapGuide Enterprise.\n\n<p>During the three days, we will be holding more than twenty training classes on  the various APIs, including introductory classes for people just starting to customise and advanced topics for professional developers. \nThere is also a business track for software business owners.\n\nHere are some of the beginner classes, most of which are targeted at Revit:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to .NET programming for non-programmers\n<li>What's new in Revit 2011 and how to use it\n<li>Introduction to the Revit API – Part 1 and 2\n<li>Leverage your content creation using the Revit API\n<li>Revit Structure API: analytical model and rebar\n<li>Introduction to Navisworks .NET API\n<li>AutoCAD MEP API programming\n<li>Introduction to the AutoCAD Civil 3D .NET API\n<li>An introduction to AutoCAD .NET API programming\n<li>An introduction to AutoCAD Architecture .NET API programming\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>These are some of the expert classes:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Presenting your analysis data in Revit\n<li>Creating and analyzing conceptual massing geometry with the Revit API\n<li>Analyze geometry of buildings using the Autodesk Revit API\n<li>Tips and tricks exploiting the Revit 2011 API\n<li>Dynamic interactions with the Revit model\n<li>The Revit MEP API\n<li>AutoCAD MEP content creation – best practices from an expert\n<li>AutoCAD Civil 3D alignments and profiles automation in .NET\n<li>AutoCAD Civil 3D styles and command settings automation in .NET\n<li>Surface manipulation through the AutoCAD Civil 3D COM API from a .NET application\n<li>Migrating AutoCAD Civil 3D subassemblies from VBA to .NET and introduction to pipe rules\n<li>The AutoCAD Map 3D workflow API\n<li>MapGuide Enterprise application development using FUSION Technology\n<li>VBA to .NET migration\n</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>There is also a track of classes on sharing, including\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Doctor is in – bring your personal development challenges, problems and needs to  get expert advice and help\n<li>AutoCAD Civil 3D .NET usability study with your input!\n<li>Talk to the Revit Product Managers\n<li>Talk to the Civil 3D Product Managers\n</li></li></li></li></ul>\n<p>And finally, a dedicated business track covers topics such as teaming with the Autodesk sales team and resellers, leveraging your relationship with Autodesk, and understanding Autodesk mergers and acquisitions.\n\n<p>I am very excited about this event, partly since I will be giving some of the presentations myself, and partly because several of the expert classes will be presented by members of the Revit development team and are guaranteed to contain in-depth information that is new to me and not obtainable elsewhere.\n\n<p>Here is the \n\n<a href=\"http://devcamps2010.autodeskevents.net/index.cfm?event=cms.page&amp;id=SIDA52A4B9ECB4B258834668C7926A5EC42\">\nfull agenda</a>, \n\nand further information and registration access is available from the \n\n<a href=\"http://devcamps2010.autodeskevents.net/index.cfm?event=cms.page&amp;id=SID3FA5EEFA001D080A3456040FDD1BD93C\">\nDevCamp 2010 website</a>.\n\nAn early bird discount rate applies until April 30, 2010.\n\n\n\n<h4>API Training Schedule</h4>\n<p>It is still a while before that becomes imminent, though.\nMeanwhile, I am still working full tilt on preparing the upcoming Revit API training for Warsaw.\nIt will be based on the new version of the API, so there is a lot of stuff to update to get all the samples working and the documentation adapted.\nWe updated the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php\">\nAPI training schedule</a> (which \n\nyou can also access from the easy-to-remember URL\n\n<a href=\"http://autodesk.com/apitraining\">\nautodesk.com/apitraining</a>).\n\nIt includes both class room and webcast trainings on the Revit API.\nTo see them all, simply select 'Revit API' from the 'Course' pulldown.\nDue to increasing popular demand and also because quite a lot has changed in the Revit 2011 API, we have more class room trainings scheduled this year:\n\n<ul>\n<li>April 7 – Warsaw</li>\n<li>May 4 – Farnborough</li>\n<li>Jul 22 – Beijing</li>\n<li>Jul 27 – Munich</li>\n<li>Aug 12 – Chennai</li>\n</ul>\n<a name=\"devlabs\"></a>\n<h4>DevLabs</h4>\n<p>The DevCamp is directly followed by one of the \n\n<a href=\"http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/01/more-devlabs-currently-planned-for-2010.html\">\nDevLabs</a> that \n\nwe are holding and which are both free and open to all developers, completely independently of ADN membership, and also listed in the training schedule.\nPlease note that the Waltham one directly after DevCamp was not present in the original list published by Kean.\nOur current schedule includes the following DevLabs with support for Revit development:\n\n<ul>\n<li>June 10-11 – Waltham, USA – \n\n<a href=\"http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=6703509&amp;siteID=123112&amp;cname=DevLab%20(AEC),%20Waltham,%20Jun%2010%202010,%20200858\">register</a>\n<li>June 21-25 – Munich, Germany\n<li>August 9-10 – Beijing, China\n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>Please also note that when I last looked, these three all had different course descriptions in the training schedule.\nTo find all three of them, you had to search for the following three separate descriptions:\n\n<ul>\n<li>DevLab (AEC)\n<li>DevLab (AutoCAD, Inventor &amp; Revit)\n<li>DevLab (Revit and Inventor) \n</li></li></li></ul>\n<p>So, lots of events, lots to prepare, lots of exciting meetings to look forward to!\n\n<p>I hope to see you at one of these venues!\n</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>"
