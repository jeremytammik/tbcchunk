My WinForms dialogs were a real bear but I finally managed to delete enough tags in the VBproj files to get them working (creating a new WinForms solution and project from scratch and doing some comparisons helped with that as it didn't have all the extra gobbledygook in it).\n\nFinally upgraded successfully with one exception:\n\n- Warning MSB3277 Found conflicts between different versions of \"WindowsBase\" that could not be resolved.\n\nI've updated to all of the latest (which I'm beginning to believe might be my issue).\nI'm working in\nVisual Studio Community 2022 Version 17.9.6\nwith\ndotnet SDK 8.0.204.\n\nI get this warning on both the ported/upgraded solution/projects as well as the solution/project that I started from scratch.\n\nHas anyone seen this warning or know a solution for resolving the conflict between the Revit API references and the newer native .NET references?\n\n**Answer:**\nFirst, congratulations on making progress, and sorry the migration is causing such a hassle for you.\n\nWarnings can be ignored.\nThey do no harm.\nOf course, it is nicer to eliminate them.\n\nActually, the very warning MSB3277 that you mention is also listed in\nthe [official Revit API .NET 8 migration guide](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/04/migrating-from-net-48-to-net-core-8.html):\n\n> Common Issues...\nHere are some common issues you may encounter when upgrading to .NET 8:\n\n> - Build Warning MSB3277\nWhen building code that references RevitAPI or RevitUIAPI, you will see the build warning MSB3277.\nTo fix this, add a reference to the Windows Desktop framework: &lt;FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App\"/&gt;\n\n**Response:**\nI did see that reference, but it doesn't say where to put it or what container node it required (I had correctly assumed that I could use the vbproj file, since it's the same xml as the csproj file) and tried adding it to the (a) `<PropertyGroup> `node at which VS completely wigged out and said that an invalid call forced VS to unload the project...\nI then spent a day following link after link in the MS documents trying to figure it out as well...\n\nI had also tried using the `Add Reference` function to see if I could load it that way, but I couldn't find it as an available loadable reference.\n\nSo, with your prompting I tried again...\nThis time I used VS intellicode to help me work it out:\nCreate a node, check to see if that node contained the `<FrameworkReference>` property, repeat until I found the correct one.\nI think this little additional piece of information would go a long way in helping people like me:\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n    &lt;FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nNow I have these references:\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/vb_2025_2.png\" alt=\"VB 2025\" title=\"VB 2025\" width=\"359\"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 431 Pixel Width: 359 -->\n</center>\n\n... along with a warning-free build.\n\nNow perhaps I'll tackle the big toolset...\n\nAdding another note to this...\n\nI'm not sure what the upgrade process does differently from one project to the next but, whatever it is it isn't consistent.\n\nOn the next project, the framework references came in differently; the `FrameworkReference` tag that the previous project required caused a warning and I had errors due to a missing reference that had been automatically added to the other projects when I set the target to windows using\n\n<pre><code>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;net8.0-windows&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;</code></pre>\n\nSo I had to do this to make it all come together:\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;\n<br/>  &lt;!-- &lt;FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App\" /&gt; --&gt;\n<br/>  &lt;FrameworkReference Include=\"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App.WindowsForms\" /&gt;\n<br/>&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n**Answer:**\nAlso found this works:\n\n<pre><code>  &lt;UseWindowsForms&gt;true&lt;/UseWindowsForms&gt;</code></pre>\n\nThis just highlights the way things have gone a bit backwards i.e. System.Drawing 4.0 instead of 8.0???\nSo, you add additional things to the point it basically becomes .NetFramework again anyway.\nYet they still can't open Revit on their mac or their phone and were never aiming to.\n\nThink they should have got rid of application macros not the document ones.\nDocument macros offered the ability to transmit functionality across offices on a project specific level, i.e., with the project files, not as some separate things such as dynamo script etc.\nApplication macros are just another way of doing the same thing as VS or pyRevit or half a dozen other things similar.\n\n**Response:**\n`UseWindowsForms` was the first tag I used (thanks to a lot of reading in the API help and the posts made here by some people that, unlike myself, actually know what they're doing)...\n\nBut... it didn't do the complete job.\nI had to delete extra lines/tags and add a few additional lines/tags...\nand scratch my head, and cuss, and try deleting some more and try adding others...\nthen cuss some more...\nthen scratch my head some more...\nBut I do now have everything compiling properly for two solutions with a total of four projects...\n\nEach project ended up requiring a slightly different combination to get them working...\nI only have two more solutions to go, yay.\n\n**Answer:**\nYes, certain things are fixed into the Frameworks, aren't they (more than there was with .NetFramework), so you have to review those already included reference versions and if you've referenced them separately historically then you have to take those out.\nIn this example there was newer references used in the Revit API DLLs due to options they compiled those with.\nSo, the baseline references used in .NET 8 were older in version than the ones included with windows desktop option.\nSo, in a lot of cases, it may be easier starting over with the project file references and adding references back as you see the related missing references errors for those.\n\nSo, as an example:\nMicrosoft.NetCore.App\ncontains\nMicrosoft.VisualBasic 10.0.0.0\nbut\nMicrosoft.WindowsDesktop.App\ncontains\nMicrosoft.VisualBasic 10.1.0.0\n\nSo, if you don't include the desktop option but include a reference that does i.e. RevitAPI.dll it tells you it is going to ignore 10.1.0.0 (since that is not added in your project). This would be a problem I suspect if you used a call from 10.0.0.0 that didn't exist anymore in 10.1.0.0 (since Revit is likely to be loading 10.1.0.0 not 10.0.0.0, first come first served).\n\nSo, isn't really VB specific that is just one of the affected assemblies that is part of Microsoft.NetCore.App but there are similar warnings for System.Drawing etc. You only encounter them if you use them in code so different projects will have same problem with different things.\n\n**Response:**\nGood advice on the start a project from scratch note.\nCreating a project(s) from scratch (in a solution(s) created from scratch) for the different types of projects I had to deal with (WinForms project, WPF project, Console App, standalone executable [the last two not related to the Revit API, just noting them], etc) was one of the methods that helped me find what was actually required and what might be able to be safely removed.\nI would recommend that for anyone making the transition from Framework to SDK.\n\nI also found a few repeated tags that were added to `<PropertyGroup>` nodes by the upgrade tool whose removal helped greatly:\n\n<pre><code>&lt;!--&lt;OutputType&gt;Library&lt;/OutputType&gt;--&gt;\n<br/>&lt;!--&lt;MyType&gt;Windows&lt;/MyType&gt;--&gt;\n<br/>&lt;!--&lt;ImportWindowsDesktopTargets&gt;true&lt;/ImportWindowsDesktopTargets&gt;--&gt;\n<br/>&lt;!--&lt;GenerateAssemblyInfo&gt;false&lt;/GenerateAssemblyInfo&gt;--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nThe `GenerateAssemblyInfo` and `ImportWindowsDesktopTargets` seemed like they would belong yet they were causing issues that seemed contra-indicative to what they would seem to be adding to the whole...\n\nOh well, if it was easy it wouldn't be any fun right?"
