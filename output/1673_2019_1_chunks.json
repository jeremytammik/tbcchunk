By building better experiences for sharing data across Autodesk tools and helping teams work together, we strive to help you get things done more efficiently.\n- Create &ndash; This category of Revit features is focused on delivering better tools, capabilities, and experiences central to authoring of project data, generating and using models.\n- Optimize &ndash; Optimize means several things in the context of Revit &ndash; it’s how we can improve your ease in working by making the software work better and by improving your interaction with the software. It’s also in delivering tools that you can use to analyze and conduct simulations to get the insights you need to make the best design decisions.\n\nRead all about them in detail in\nthe [tour of the Revit 2019.1 new features](http://blogs.autodesk.com/revit/2018/08/15/revit-2019-1-new-features-in-the-latest-release).\n\nThe release notes are provided \nin [Autodesk_Revit_2019_1_Readme.htm](https://up.autodesk.com/2019/RVT/Autodesk_Revit_2019_1_Readme.htm).\n\nI downloaded `Autodesk_Revit_2019_1.exe` from my Autodesk account and installed it.\nThe about box now lists it as Revit version 19.1.0.112, build number 20180806_1515(x64).\n\nRevit 2019.1 also sports an updated SDK that is in the process of being posted to\nthe [Revit Developer Center](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit) right now.\n\nWe'll discuss detailed information about what's new in the Revit API anon.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, the first place to look is in the SDK documentation, as soon as you get your hands on it, in *Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx*.

We will discuss them in detail soon. Right now, however, I would like to point out up front one important aspect that might affect your Revit add-ins if they make use of the [`CEFsharp` web browser library](https://cefsharp.github.io). If so, please read on.   \n \nRevit and Autodesk add-ins use the CEFsharp library internally for several features. Some third-party add-ins do so as well.\n\nOccasionally, when different versions of the library are used, it leads to instability issues for Revit.\n\nIn order to avoid version conflicts, we are clarifying what CEFsharp version is being used: Revit uses CEFsharp version  57.0.0.\n\nIn addition, Revit 2019.1 now forcibly loads a version of CEFsharp prior to add-in initialization.\n\nThis means that add-ins which load a different version of the CEFsharp library may not function as expected.\n\nAutodesk recommends realigning add-ins to use the version provided by and loaded by Revit.\n\nThe Revit 2019.1 features that use the CEFsharp library include the new *Revit Home* and the *Site Collaboration with Civil 3D*.\n\nThis information was already shared by Mikako Harada in \nthe [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread \non [Revit 2019.1 add-ins and CEFsharp library](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-2019-1-add-in-and-cefsharp-library/td-p/8205740),\nand also discussed in the thread describing how some developers struggled after\nthe [Revit 2019.1 update broke add-ins using CEF](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/psa-do-not-use-cef-in-your-addin-and-how-revit-2019-1-broke-it/td-p/8205465)."
