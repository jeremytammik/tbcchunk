copy \"C:\\Program Files\\Autodesk\\Revit Kepler\\RevitAddInUtility.dll\" \"..\\Revit 2017\"\n</pre>\n\nWith CancelSave compiling successfully, the [next error occurred in PlacementOptions](zip/sdk_samples_2017_03.txt), which has a setting requiring all public members to be equipped with an XML documentation comment:\n\n<pre>\nC:\\...\\PlacementOptions\\CS\\Command.cs(151,9,151,18): error CS1591: Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member 'PlacementOptionsEnum.FaceBased'\n\nC:\\...\\PlacementOptions\\CS\\Command.cs(152,9,152,20): error CS1591: Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member 'PlacementOptionsEnum.SketchBased'\n</pre>\n\nI resolved that by adding the required comments and passed that on to the development team in REVIT-89865 [API: PlacementOptions Revit SDK sample compilation error]:\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n&nbsp;
