[below](#3)\n- MEP Electrical Circuits: Improved the API ElectricalSystem.Create() to make it use the voltage of the first matched connector when creating an electrical system with the connectors whose voltages were mapped to an instance parameter, cf. ricaun's comment on the Revit API forum discussion thread\non [NewElectricalSystem specify voltage and poles](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/newelectricalsystem-specify-voltage-amp-poles/m-p/12366308#M75140) &ndash; thank you, Luiz!\n- Dynamo for Revit: Upgraded Dynamo Core version to 2.19.3.
