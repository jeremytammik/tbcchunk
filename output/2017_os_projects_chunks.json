In the following what I have come up with so far and I´m looking forward to your thoughts and hopefully contributions! The code is on Github.\n\n> Some rules for the code:\n\n> - Every script is a full working code including imports.\n- Necessary imports only.\n- No inputs from dynamo needed, necessary elements are created in the code.\n- Dynamo code: tabs as indent only.\n- pyRevit 1 code: spaces as indent only.\n- No comments, just clean code.\n- snake_case only, for variables, functions, everything.\n- No “for i in a:”, proper names for everything (except list comprehension).\n\n> Code is available in different versions, [check the original post for examples](https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/revitpythondocs-for-dynamo-and-pyrevit-request-for-feedback/95280)...\n\nMany thanks to Gerhard for the initiative and to Jacob Small for pointing it out."
