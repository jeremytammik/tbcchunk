Happy to hear that the problem is solved and the solution clear and simple.\n\nI'll spell it out in the blog again and hope that will be easier to find in case anyone runs into this again in the future.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/rain_water_collector_sheet.jpg\" alt=\"Rain water collector\" title=\"Rain water collector\" width=\"330\"/> <!-- 330 -->\n</center>"

    "chunk_text": "####<a name=\"5\"></a> Python and Dynamo Autotag Without Overlap\n\nChristopher Kepner shared a nice brute force Python solution\nimplementing [Auto Tagging without overlap](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/auto-tagging-without-overlap/m-p/10036344),\nexplaining the algorithm like this:\n\nA python script to auto-tag all doors and place them without clashing with other tags or doors, using a custom smart tag that is much bigger than typical door tag.\n\nIt starts with a list of doors in the variable `doorFiltered`. \n\nThe location point of the first door in the list is fed into the function below to provide a test point to see if it overlaps any location points in the list of doors:\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n  def move_right(x,y,z):\n    n = scaleFactor\n    return x+n, y, z\n  \n  def move_down(x,y,z):\n    n = scaleFactor\n    return x,y-n,z\n  \n  def move_left(x,y,z):\n    n = scaleFactor\n    return x-n,y,z\n  \n  def move_up(x,y,z):\n    n = scaleFactor\n    return x,y+n,z\n  \n  moves = [move_right, move_down, move_left, move_up]\n  \n  def shift(end, point):\n    from itertools import cycle\n    _moves = cycle(moves)\n    n = 1\n    pos = point\n    times_to_move = 1\n  \n    yield pos\n  \n    while True:\n      for _ in range(2):\n        move = next(_moves)\n        for _ in range(times_to_move):\n          if n >= end:\n            return\n          pos = move(*pos)\n          n+=1\n          yield pos\n  \n      times_to_move+=1\n</pre>\n\nIf the point lands too close to any door locations in the list, the code adds a integer to the function and runs again to provide the next test point. Each time the function is re-run, the next point follows a spiral pattern from the origin (location point of the first door):\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"img/autotagging_spiral.png\" alt=\"Autotagging spiral\" title=\"Autotagging spiral\" width=\"200\"/> <!-- 394 -->\n</center>\n\nOnce a point is found that is far enough from the list of door locations, a tag is placed and the tag location is added to the list of door locations.\n\nThe process loops to the next door, checking against the list of door location plus the new tag location.\n\nIt's a working concept, but the output is inconsistent.\n\nIssues include:\n\n- Tags occasionally overlap with each other.\n- The process takes a while. there's tons of points it tests that fail.\n- Tag location it finds does not work well with leaders. the tags land in every direction from the door creating overlap of leaders. It might work better with smaller tags.\n\n**Answer:** LOL. If you make the tags small enough, the problem will disappear entirely, along with the tags.\n\nThank you very much for the explanation. Brute force and effective, given time. I love that straightforward approach!\n\nAnother recent tagging conversation\non [tags without overlapping](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/tags-without-overlapping/m-p/7750631)\nmentions a couple of other useful possibilities.\n\nMore complex approaches are discussed on the Internet under the\nterm '[map labelling algorithms](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=map+labelling+algorithm)'.\n\nFinally, Konrad Sobon of [archi+lab](https://archi-lab.net)\ndiscussed [element tagging with dynamo](https://archi-lab.net/element-tagging-with-dynamo)\nto create roof plans for a glass canopy system and tag each panel with its unique `Mark` value:\n\n> basically, it's a Revit’s Tag All tool, but with extra control over where the tag actually gets placed."
